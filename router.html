    <h2>2.1.1 Security Issue Overview</h2>
    <p>Each security issue identified by DigInv is described with a finding, the impact of the issue, how easy it would be for an attacker to exploit the issue and a recommendation.</p>
    <h4>Issue Finding</h4>
    <p>The issue finding describes what DigInv identified during the security audit. Typically, the finding will include background information on what particular configuration settings are prior to describing what was found.</p>
    <h4>Issue Impact</h4>
    <p>The issue impact describes what an attacker could achieve from exploiting the security audit finding. However, it is worth noting that the impact of an issue can often be influenced by other configuration settings,         which could heighten or partially mitigate the issue. For example, a weak password could be partially         mitigated if the access gained from using it is restricted in some way.</p>
    <h4>Issue Ease</h4>
    <p>The issue ease describes the knowledge, skill, level of access and time scales that would be required by an attacker in order to exploit an issue. The issue ease will describe, where relevant, if any Open Source or commercially available tools could be used to exploit an issue.</p>
    <h4>Issue Recommandation</h4>
    <p>Each issue includes a recommendation section which describes the steps that DigInv recommends should be taken in order to mitigate the issue. The recommendation includes, where relevant, the commands that can be used to resolve the issue.</p>
    <h2>2.1.2 Rating System Overview</h2>
    <p>Each issue identified in the security audit is rated against both the impact of the issue and how easy it would be for an attacker to exploit. The fix rating provides a guide to the effort required to resolve the issue. The overall rating for the issue is calculated based on the issue's impact and ease ratings.</p>
    <h4>Impact Rating</h4>
    <p>An issue's impact rating is determined using the criteria outlined in the Table below.</p><table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>CRITICAL</td>
      <td>These issues can pose a very significant security threat. The issues that have a critical impact are typically those that would allow an attacker to gain full administrative access to the device. For a firewall device, allowing all traffic to pass through the device unfiltered would receive this rating as filtering traffic to protect other devices is the primary purpose of a firewall.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>HIGH</td>
      <td>These issues pose a significant threat to security, but have some limitations on the extent to which they can be abused. User level access to a device and a DoS vulnerability in a critical service would fall into this category. A firewall device that allowed significant unfiltered access, such as allowing entire subnets through or not filtering in all directions, would fall into this category. A router that allows significant modification of its routing configuration would also fall into this category.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>MEDIUM</td>
      <td>These issues have significant limitations on the direct impact they can cause. Typically, these issues would include significant information leakage issues, less significant DoS issues or those that provide significantly limited access. An SNMP service that is secured with a default or a dictionary-based community string would typically fall into this rating, as would a firewall that allows unfiltered access to a range of services on a device.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>LOW</td>
      <td>These issues represent a low level security threat. A typical issue would involve information leakage that could be useful to an attacker, such as a list of users or version details</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>INFORMATIONAL</td>
      <td>These issues represent a very low level of security threat. These issues include minor information leakage, unnecessary services or legacy protocols that present no real threat to security</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>EASY</td>
      <td>The issue requires some knowledge for an attacker to exploit, which could be performed using standard operating system tools or tools downloaded from the Internet. An administrative service without or with a default password would fall into this category, as would a simple software vulnerability exploit.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>MODERATE</td>
      <td>The issue requires specific knowledge on behalf of an attacker. The issue could be exploited using a combination of operating system tools or publicly available tools downloaded from the Internet.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>CHALLENGE</td>
      <td>A security issue that falls into this category would require significant effort and knowledge on behalf of the attacker. The attacker may require specific physical access to resources or to the network infrastructure in order to successfully exploit the vulnerability. Furthermore, a combination of attacks may be required.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>

          <h3>1. UDP Small Services Enabled</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Some devices and platforms provide a collection of simple User Datagram Protocol (UDP) network services, which are also sometimes referred to Fix: Quick as small services. These services provide little functionality and are rarely used and they typically include:
Echo (defined in RFC 862) returns any data sent to it back to the connecting client;
Discard (defined in RFC 863) ignores any data sent to it by a connecting client;
Chargen (defined in RFC 864) generates printable characters which are returned to the connecting client.
DigInv determined that the UDP small servers were enabled</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker could use the UDP small servers as part of a DoS attack. UDP is a connection-less protocol and an experienced attacker could forge network packets to use the echo and chargen services to increase the network traffic and system utilization of devices offering the services. Additionally, each running service increases the chances of an attacker being able to identify the device and successfully compromise it. Although not as significant, some of the services may provide an attacker with simple information that could then be used as part of a targeted attack against the system.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Tools that can be used to connect to these services are installed by default on some systems or can be downloaded from the Internet.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that the UDP small servers should be disabled.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. No HTTP Server Session Timeout</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>The HTTP server session timeout setting is used to determine if a web session is no longer being used, enabling a device to determine when a connection can be automatically disconnected. A HTTP server session could become unused if an administrator has not properly terminated a connection and remains authenticated, such as when a user does not click on a logout button. The session could also become unused if the user leaves their computer unattended without terminating the session.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>If an attacker was able to access a system using an authenticated session that is no longer being used, the attacker would be able to perform information gathering, configuration and other malicious activities under the context of the previous authenticated user. The level of access could potentially be at an administrative level.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>To exploit this issue an attacker would first have to identify a working HTTP server session, possibly prior to it becoming unused by the user, and then be able to control that web session. This may be as simple as using the users computer whilst they are away, otherwise the attacker may have to exploit a weakness in the protocol or perform a man-in-the-middle attack. The man-in-the-middle attack could be performed using a proxy server, but a user could become suspicious if the session is using Hypertext Transfer Protocol over SSL (HTTPS) and the web browser provides the user with a certificate warning.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that a HTTP server session timeout period of 10 minutes should be configured.</li>

          <h3>3. No Inbound TCP Connection Keep-Alives</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>The keep-alive messages are used to determine if a connection is active or has become orphaned and is no longer used. Depending on the result, the device can reclaim resources allocated to inbound connections that have become orphaned. Connections to a device could become orphaned if a connection becomes disrupted or if the client has not properly terminated a connection.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker could attempt a DoS attack against a device by exhausting the number of possible connections. To perform this attack, the attacker could keep requesting new connections to the device and spoof the source IP addresses. This would then prevent any new legitimate connections to the device from being made as the device awaits the completion of the connection attempts that have already been initiated. This attack would prevent both users and administrators from connecting to the device.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Tools can be downloaded from the Internet that are capable of opening a large number of TCP connections without correctly terminating them.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that TCP keep alive messages should be sent to detect and drop orphaned connections from remote systems.</li>

          <h3>4. IP Classless</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Classless routing is enabled by default on Cisco routers. If a router has classless routing enabled and it receives a network packet for which there is no configured route, the router will forward the packet to the best destination. With classless routing disabled, the router would discard any network traffic for which no route is defined.
DigInv determined that classless routing was enabled</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Network traffic that should not be routed by the router may be routed when classless routing is enabled.</li>

          <h3>5. AUX Port Not Disabled</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>The Auxilary (AUX) port's primary purpose is to provide a remote administration capability. With a modem connected to the AUX port, a remote administrator could dial into the device in order to perform remote administration. As an extra layer of security, some devices can be configured with a callback facility. The callback facility, if configured, drops any incoming calls and dials the network administrator back.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>If an attacker is able to dial in and connect to the device remotely using the AUX port, the attacker could perform a brute-force attack against the authentication mechanism in order to gain remote administrative access. If a malicious user was able to gain physical access to a device where the AUX port had not been disabled, they could attach a modem in order to perform an attack from a remote location. If a callback facility has not been configured, then the device would not drop incoming calls and attempt to dial the network administrators phone number.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>In order to successfully exploit this issue, the attacker would require a modem to be attached to the AUX port. If a modem is already attached, an attacker could discover the modem's telephone number during a war-dial. However, even though a number of war dial tools are available on the Internet, a war dial is more likely to be discovered due to the number of telephones which would be called in an office.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that, if not required, the AUX port should be disabled. If the AUX port is required and the device supports callback then DigInv suggests that the callback facility should be configured as an additional level of protection.</li>

          <h3>6. No HTTP Service Network Access Restrictions</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>HTTP (RFC 2616) provides web-based services, such as information services, network device administration and other potentially sensitive services. HTTP provides no encryption of the connection between the client and server including any authentication and data transfer. HTTPS, which is HTTP over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/TLS, is used to provide cryptographically secure web-based connection. Network access to the HTTP service can be restricted by specifying those hosts that are allowed to access the service and thereby denying access to all other network host addresses.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Without management host address restrictions an attacker, or malicious user, with authentication credentials would be able to connect to the HTTPS service, logon and access the functionality and information provided for that user. If an attacker does not have authentication credentials they could attempt a brute- force attack in order to identify valid credentials. Additionally, if there is a vulnerability with the service then allowing anyone to connect to the service could enable an attacker to exploit the vulnerability.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>With no HTTP network host access restrictions an attacker would not be prevented from connecting to the service. Furthermore, web browsers and other web- based client tools are included as standard with most operating systems. Alternative web service tools are available on the Internet, together with vulnerability exploit code, enumeration and brute-force tools.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that access to the HTTP service should be restricted to only those network hosts that require access.</li>

          <h3>7. Service Password Encryption Disabled</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Cisco service passwords are stored by default in their clear-text form rather than being encrypted. However, it is possible to have these passwords stored using the reversible Cisco type-7 encryption.

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>CDP is a proprietary protocol that was developed and is primarily used by Cisco. A CDP enabled device can be configured to broadcast.
CDP packets on the network enabling network management applications and CDP aware devices to identify each other. CDP packets include information about thesender, such as OS version and IP address information.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>CDP packets contain information about the sender, such as hardware model information, operating system version and IP address details. This information would give an attacker valuable information about the device. The attacker could then use this information as part of a targeted attack.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>CDP packets are broadcast to an entire network segment. The attacker or malicious user would require access to a network segment on which the CDP packets are broadcast and network monitoring software. A wide variety of network monitoring, packet capture and analysis tools can be downloaded from the Internet.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that, if not required, CDP should be disabled.
In some configurations with IP phones, deployed using either Auto Discovery or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), the CDP service may need to be enabled.

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>VTP was developed by Cisco to assist with the management of VLANs over multiple devices. The protocol enables the addition, renaming and deletion of VLANs on a single switch to be propagated to other network switches in the same VTP domain. A device in VTP server mode will transmit VTP packets containing VLAN information. If a device in VTP client mode in the same domain receives a VTP network packet with a higher revision number the changes will be applied.
 DigInv determined that VTP was in server mode.It is worth mentioning that although the VTP was found to be in server mode(adefault setting), no VTP domain was configured. However, there have been instances where a device in this configuration have had their VTP domain setremotely from other networked devices.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker could determine the VLAN configuration by capturing VTP packets sent from the device and VTP packets are not encrypted, even when a password is specified. The attacker could then use the VLAN information or password as part of a targeted attack.</li>

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>TCP/IP packets can contain source route information, this can enable a packet to define its own route through a network rather than using a route defined by static routes or routing protocols. The source route option functionality was defined in RFC 791.
Many network filtering and routing devices include facilities that enable them to ignore the source route defined in a packet or block the packets entirely.
 DigInv determined that IP source routing was enabled</p>

            <li>IP source routing can allow an attacker to specify a route for a network packet to follow, possibly to bypass a Firewall device or an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). An attacker could also use source routing to capture network traffic by routing it through a system controlled by the attacker.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>An attacker would have to control either a routing device or an end point device in order to modify a packets route through the network.

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>BOOTstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a datagram protocol that allows compatible hosts to load their operating system over the network from a BOOTP server. Cisco routers are capable of acting as BOOTP servers for other Cisco devices and the service is enabled by default. However, BOOTP is rarely used and may represent a security risk.
DigInv determined that BOOTP was not disabled. However, it is worth noting that not all Cisco devices support BOOTP.</p>

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>HTTP (RFC 2616) provides web-based services, such as information services, network device administration and other potentially sensitive services. HTTP provides no encryption of the connection between the client and server including any authentication and data transfer.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Due to the lack of encryption provided by the HTTP service, an attacker who is able to monitor a session would be able to view all of the authentication credentials and data passed in the session. The attacker could then attempt to gain access to the device using the authentication credentials extracted from the session and potentially gain access under the context of that user. Since HTTP is commonly used for network device administration this could gain the attacker an administrative level of access.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>To exploit the fact that the HTTP service does not provide any encryption, the attacker would need to be able to monitor the session between a HTTP server and web browser. In some situations the attacker may not need to perform any further action other than launching a network monitoring tool. However, in a switched network the attacker may need to perform additional actions such as an ARP attack and in a routed environment the attacker may have to compromise the network routing.Tools that are capable of both monitoring and displaying network traffic in an easy to read form can be downloaded from the Internet. There are also tools that automatically detect where authentication credentials or files are being transferred and display or save the data. Tools are also available that enable an attacker to easily perform a variety of network attacks in order to be able to monitor and intercept sessions between two network devices.</p>

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>OSPF is a routing protocol that can be configured to dynamically update the routing table with changes to the network topology. OSPF uses LSA to communicate changes to other routers and update the routers own Link State Database (LSDB). Devices can be configured with a LSA message threshold in order to limit the number of LSA messages being processed by the device.</p>

          <h3>1. Connection Timeout not configured</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Connection timeouts can be configured for a number of the device services. If a timeout were configured on an administrative service, an administrator that did not correctly terminate the connection would have it automatically closed after the timeout expires. However, if a timeout is not configured, or is configured to be a long timeout, an unauthorised user may be able to gain access using the administrator's previously logged-in connection.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker who was able to gain access to a connection that had not expired, would be able to continue using that connection. A connection could be a console port on the device that was not correctly terminated or a remote administrative connection.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>The attacker would have to gain physical access to the device to use the console port, or gain remote access to an administration machine that is attached to the port. To gain access to remote connections, an attacker would have to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the device. The attacker would then have to take over the connection, which could be very difficult with some services. Tools are available on the Internet that would facilitate the monitoring of network connections.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv ecommends that a timeout period of ten minutes be configured for connections to the device</li>
