<hr><h2>2. <a name="SecurityAudit">Security Audit</a></h2>
<h3>2.1. <a name="sec_Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
Nipper performed a security audit of the Cisco Router Router on Saturday 19th March 2022. This section details the findings of the security audit together with the impact and recommendations.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.2. <a name="sec_Dictionary-basedPasswords/Keys">Dictionary-based Passwords / Keys</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Attackers will often have dictionaries of words that contain names, places, default passwords and other common passwords. If a password or key is likely to be contained within an attacker's dictionary, they could gain access to the system.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The passwords and keys of the device Router were tested against a small dictionary and six passwords / keys were identified. These are listed in Table 2.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<table class="table">
 <caption>Table 2: Dictionary-based passwords / keys</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Type</th>
   <th>Service</th>
   <th>Username</th>
   <th>Password</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
 <tbody>
<tr><td>Password</td><td>Users</td><td>Admin</td><td>admin</td></tr>
<tr><td>Key</td><td>OSPF</td><td>FastEthernet0/1</td><td>cisco</td></tr>
<tr><td>Key</td><td>OSPF</td><td>FastEthernet0/2</td><td>cisco</td></tr>
<tr><td>Community</td><td>SNMP</td><td>read-only</td><td>private</td></tr>
<tr><td>Community</td><td>SNMP</td><td>read/write</td><td>public</td></tr>
<tr><td>Password</td><td>Line</td><td>Console line 0</td><td>password</td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;<br>

<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who was able to identify a password or key would be able to gain a level of access to the device, based on what service the password / key was used for.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Tools are available on the Internet that can perform dictionary-based password guessing against a number of network services.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper strongly recommends that the passwords identified be immediately changed to something that is more difficult to guess. Nipper recommends that passwords be made up of at least eight characters in length and contain either uppercase or lowercase characters and numbers.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.3. <a name="sec_WeakPasswords/Keys">Weak Passwords / Keys</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Strong passwords tend to contain a number of different types of character, such as uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers and punctuation characters. Weaker passwords tend not to contain a mixture of character types. Additionally, weaker passwords tend to be short in length.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper identified nine passwords / keys that did not meet the minimum password complexity requirements. These are listed in Table 3.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<table class="table">
 <caption>Table 3: Weak passwords / keys</caption>

  <tr>
   <th>Type</th>
   <th>Service</th>
   <th>Username</th>
   <th>Password</th>
  </tr>

 <tbody>
<tr><td>Password</td><td>Users</td><td>Admin</td><td>admin</td></tr>
<tr><td>Password</td><td>Users</td><td>mohamed</td><td>1234</td></tr>
<tr><td>Key</td><td>OSPF</td><td>FastEthernet0/1</td><td>cisco</td></tr>
<tr><td>Key</td><td>OSPF</td><td>FastEthernet0/2</td><td>cisco</td></tr>
<tr><td>Community</td><td>SNMP</td><td>read-only</td><td>private</td></tr>
<tr><td>Community</td><td>SNMP</td><td>read/write</td><td>public</td></tr>
<tr><td>Password</td><td>Line</td><td>Console line 0</td><td>password</td></tr>
<tr><td>Password</td><td>Line</td><td>AUX line 0</td><td>123456</td></tr>
<tr><td>Password</td><td>VRRP</td><td>Group ID 100 on interface FastEthernet0/1</td><td>text</td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;<br>

<b>Impact:</b> If an attacker were able to gain a password or key, either through dictionary-based guessing techniques or by a brute-force method, the attacker could gain a level of access to Router.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> A number of dictionary-based password guessing and password brute-force tools are available on the Internet.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper strongly recommends that the weak passwords be immediately changed to ones that are stronger. Nipper recommends that passwords be made up of at least eight characters in length and contain either uppercase or lowercase characters and numbers.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.4. <a name="sec_BorderGatewayProtocolRouteFlapping">Border Gateway Protocol Route Flapping</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) route flapping is a condition where routing tables are constantly being updated due to a link transitioning between up and down status. These transitions cause routing tables to be continuously updated across the infrastructure. Configuring route dampening can help mitigate against constant route flapping.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that BGP route dampening was not configured on Router.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Excessive route updates, caused by a link status constantly changing between up to down, can impact network routing performance. Network routing could slow with network packets being dropped, possibly causing a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> It is possible for an attacker to send BGP packets to a router to update the routing table and cause a route flapping condition. However, the attacker may need additional information in order to perform the attack, such as a BGP password.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that BGP route dampening be configured. Additionally, there are a number of BGP dampening options that can be configured. The following Cisco Internet Operating System (IOS) router command will enable BGP route dampening:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">bgp dampening</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.5. <a name="sec_EIGRPAuthentication">EIGRP Authentication</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Cisco developed Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) as an enhanced version of Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP), an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) used by routers to dynamically update routing tables. Each interface where EIGRP is used can be configured with MD5-based authentication.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that three EIGRP interfaces were configured with no authentication, these are listed in Table 4.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<table class="table">
 <caption>Table 4: Interfaces with no EIGRP authentication</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Interface</th>
   <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
 <tbody>
<tr><td>Serial0/0/1</td><td>serial comm</td></tr>
<tr><td>FastEthernet0/1</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>FastEthernet0/2</td><td></td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;<br>

<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who is able to update the routing tables could capture network traffic, perform a network-wide DoS or a man-in-the-middle attack.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Once an attacker has established the type of authentication in use, they could use the information to pose as a router and insert routes into the routing tables by sending specially crafted EIGRP packets. EIGRP packets can be captured using a variety of techniques and tools are available on the Internet that can be used to exploit insecure EIGRP configurations.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that all EIGRP interfaces be configured with EIGRP MD5-based authentication. Furthermore, Nipper recommends that all interfaces where EIGRP is not required be configured as passive. EIGRP MD5 authentication can be configured on each interface with the following commands:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">ip authentication mode eigrp {<i>autonomous number</i>} md5</div>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">ip authentication key-chain eigrp {<i>autonomous number</i>} {<i>key chain</i>}</div>&nbsp;<br>
Passive interfaces can be configured with the following EIGRP router command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">passive-interface {<i>interface type</i>} {<i>interface number</i>}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.6. <a name="sec_RIPAuthentication">RIP Authentication</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is a routing protocol that allows network devices to dynamically adapt to changes in the network infrastructure, enabling network devices to forward traffic using the shortest route to their destination. There are two versions of RIP configurable on Cisco Router devices. RIP version 2 provides a mechanism where routing updates can be authenticated, however RIP version 1 provides no similar mechanism. RIP version 2 supports clear-text authentication and MD5 authentication.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that RIP had been configured without encrypted authentication for sent and received updates on three network interfaces, these are listed in Table 5.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<table class="table">
 <caption>Table 5: Insecure RIP interface configurations</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Interface</th>
   <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
 <tbody>
<tr><td>Serial0/0/1</td><td>No RIP version 2 key chain or MD5 authentication was configured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>FastEthernet0/1</td><td>No RIP version 2 key chain or MD5 authentication was configured.</td></tr>
<tr><td>FastEthernet0/2</td><td>No RIP version 2 key chain or MD5 authentication was configured.</td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;<br>

<b>Impact:</b> If RIP updates are sent and received without encrypted authentication an attacker may be able to inject their own route into the routing table. An attacker could modify routes in order to enable the capture of network traffic or to perform a network DoS.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> An attacker would have to determine what authentication, if any, was configured. Once an attacker has identified an insecure RIP configuration they could attempt to pose as a router and inject routes. Tools are available on the Internet that can transmit RIP updates.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends RIP be configured with encrypted authentication for all interfaces where RIP packets will be sent and received. Furthermore, Nipper recommends that all interfaces where RIP will not be used be configured as passive. RIP version 2 can be configured with the following router command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">version 2</div>&nbsp;<br>
RIP authentication can be configured on each interface using the following commands:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">ip rip authentication key-chain {<i>Key Chain</i>}</div>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">ip rip authentication mode md5</div>&nbsp;<br>
RIP can be disabled on each individual interfaces using the following router command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">passive-interface {<i>interface type</i>} {<i>interface number</i>}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.7. <a name="sec_VRRPAuthentication">VRRP Authentication</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Cisco Router devices support Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), which is used for router load balancing and redundancy. One VRRP group router will be a master router and VRRP advertisements are sent from it to group members. The advertisements contain the priority and state of the master. If the master router becomes unavailable, an election is held to determine a new VRRP master router. VRRP messages can be unauthenticated or authenticated. VRRP authentication uses either a clear-text password or a MD5 password.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that VRRP was configured on Router without MD5 authentication on all VRRP interfaces.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker could transmit VRRP group messages in an attempt to become the VRRP master. If an attacker were able to become the VRRP group master, they could modify the network traffic route in order to capture traffic or to perform a network DoS.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> The attacker would have to monitor VRRP traffic in order to determine the VRRP group, priority and the authentication method in use. The attacker would then have to transmit VRRP group messages with a higher priority than the VRRP master in order to become the VRRP master.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that MD5 authentication be configured on all VRRP interfaces. MD5 VRRP key string authentication can be configured on each VRRP interface with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">vrrp {<i>group</i>} authentication md5 {[key-string <i>password</i>] | [key-chain <i>key chain</i>]}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.8. <a name="sec_InboundTCPConnectionKeepAlives">Inbound TCP Connection Keep Alives</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Connections to a Cisco Router device could become orphaned if a connection becomes disrupted. An attacker could attempt a DoS attack against a Cisco Router by exhausting the number of possible connections. Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) keep alive messages can be configured to confirm that a remote connection is valid and then terminate any orphaned connections.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that TCP keep alive messages are not sent for connections from remote hosts.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker could attempt a DoS by exhausting the number of possible connections.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Tools are available on the Internet that can open large numbers of TCP connections without correctly terminating them.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that TCP keep alive messages be sent to detect and drop orphaned connections from remote systems. TCP keep alive messages can be enabled for connections from remote systems using the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">service tcp-keepalives-in</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.9. <a name="sec_ConnectionTimeout">Connection Timeout</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Connection timeouts can be configured for a number of the device services. If a timeout were configured on an administrative service, an administrator that did not correctly terminate the connection would have it automatically closed after the timeout expires. However, if a timeout is not configured, or is configured to be a long timeout, an unauthorised user may be able to gain access using the administrator's previously logged-in connection.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper identified three connection settings that were not configured to timeout within ten minutes, these are listed in Table 6.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<table class="table">
 <caption>Table 6: Connections with inadequate timeout periods</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Connection</th>
   <th>Timeout</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
 <tbody>
<tr><td>Console line 0</td><td>No Timeout</td></tr>
<tr><td>Auxiliary line 0</td><td>No Timeout</td></tr>
<tr><td>VTY lines 0 to 4</td><td>No Timeout</td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;<br>

<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who was able to gain access to a connection that had not expired, would be able to continue using that connection. A connection could be a console port on the device that was not correctly terminated or a remote administrative connection.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> The attacker would have to gain physical access to the device to use the console port, or gain remote access to an administration machine that is attached to the port. To gain access to remote connections, an attacker would have to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and Router. The attacker would then have to take over the connection, which could be very difficult with some services. Tools are available on the Internet that would facilitate the monitoring of network connections.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that a timeout period of ten minutes be configured for connections to the device Router.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.10. <a name="sec_AuxiliaryPort">Auxiliary Port</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> The auxiliary port's primary purpose is to provide a remote administration capability. It can allow a remote administrator to use a modem to dial into the Cisco device.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that the auxiliary port on the Cisco device Router allowed exec connections and did not appear to have the callback feature configured.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker may discover the modem number for the device during a war-dial. If an attacker were able to connect to the device remotely, then they may be able to brute-force the login to gain access to the device.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> The attacker would have to first identify the telephone number of the device, probably through a war-dial. A modem attached to a telephone line would have to be attached directly to the Cisco device's auxiliary port. Then the attacker would be able to attach to the device in order to perform a brute-force of the login.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if not required, the auxiliary port exec be disabled. Exec can be disabled on the aux port with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no exec</div>&nbsp;<br>
If the auxiliary port is required for remote administration, the callback feature can be configured to dial a specific preconfigured telephone number.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.11. <a name="sec_IPSourceRouting">IP Source Routing</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> IP source routing is a feature whereby a network packet can specify how it should be routed through the network. Cisco routers normally accept and process source routes specified by a packet, unless the feature has been disabled.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that IP source routing was not disabled.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> IP source routing can allow an attacker to specify a route for a network packet to follow, possibly to bypass a Firewall device or an Intruder Detection System (IDS). An attacker could also use source routing to capture network traffic by routing it through a system controlled by the attacker.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> An attacker would have to control either a routing device or an end point device in order to modify a packets route through the network. However, tools are available on the Internet that would allow an attacker to specify source routes. Tools are also available to modify network routing using vulnerabilities in some routing protocols.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if not required, IP source routing be disabled. IP source routing can be disabled by issuing the following IOS command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip source routing</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.12. <a name="sec_HyperTextTransportProtocolService">HyperText Transport Protocol Service</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Recent Cisco IOS-based devices support web-based administration using the HTTP protocol. Cisco web-based administration facilities can sometimes be basic but they do provide a simple method of administering remote devices. However, HTTP is a clear-text protocol and is vulnerable to various packet-capture techniques.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The HTTP service was configured and made use of an access-list to restrict access to the device.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who was able to monitor network traffic could capture authentication credentials. This issue is made more serious with the enable password being used for authentication as this would give the attacker full administrative access to the device with the captured credentials. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Network packet and password sniffing tools are widely available on the Internet. Once authentication credentials have been captured it is trivial to use the credentials to log in using the captured credentials. <br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if not required, the HTTP service be disabled. If a remote method of access to the device is required, consider using HTTPS or Secure Shell (SSH). The encrypted HTTPS and SSH services may require a firmware or hardware upgrade. The HTTP service can be disabled with the following IOS command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip http server</div>&nbsp;<br>
If it is not possible to upgrade the device to use the encrypted HTTPS or SSH services, additional security can be configured. The authentication method can be changed using the following command (where the authentication method is either local, enable, tacacs or aaa):<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">ip http authentication [<i>authentication method</i>]</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.13. <a name="sec_SimpleNetworkManagementProtocol">Simple Network Management Protocol</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is used to assist network administrators in monitoring and managing a wide variety of network devices. There are three main versions of SNMP in use. Versions 1 and 2 of SNMP are both secured with a community string and authenticate and transmit network packets without any form of encryption. SNMP version 3 provides several levels of authentication and encryption. The most basic level provides a similar protection to that of the earlier protocol versions. However, SNMP version 3 can be configured to provide encrypted authentication (auth) and secured further with support for encrypted data communications (priv).<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that SNMP protocol version 1 was configured on Router.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Due to the unencrypted nature of SNMP protocol versions 1 and 2c, an attacker who was able to monitor network traffic could capture device configuration settings, including authentication details.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Network packet monitoring and capture tools are widely available on the Internet and SNMP tools are included as standard with some operating systems.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if possible, SNMP version 1 be disabled. Furthermore, Nipper recommends that, if SNMP is required, protocol version 3 be configured with Auth and Priv authentication. SNMP protocol version 1 can be disabled with the following command for each community string:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no snmp-server community {<i>Community String</i>} {[RO] | [RW]}</div>&nbsp;<br>
SNMP version 3 Auth and Priv access can be configured with the following commands:<br>

&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.14. <a name="sec_Telnet">Telnet</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Telnet is widely used to provide remote command-based access to a variety of devices and is commonly used on network devices for remote administration. However, Telnet is a clear-text protocol and is vulnerable to various packet capture techniques.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that Telnet was enabled on Router.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who was able to monitor network traffic could capture sensitive information or authentication credentials.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Network packet and password sniffing tools are widely available on the Internet and some of the tools are specifically designed to capture clear-text protocol authentication credentials. However, in a switched environment an attacker may not be able to capture network traffic destined for other devices without employing an attack such as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if possible, Telnet be disabled. If remote administrative access to the device is required, Nipper recommends that SSH be configured. The Telnet service can be disabled on individual lines with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">transport input none</div>&nbsp;<br>
The following Cisco IOS command can be used to disable Telnet on individual lines, but enable SSH:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">transport input ssh</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.15. <a name="sec_ICMPRedirects">ICMP Redirects</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) redirect messages allow systems to change the route that network traffic takes. On networks with functional network routing, disabling ICMP redirects will have little to no effect. ICMP redirects are usually enabled by default on Cisco devices.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that the device Router had support for ICMP redirects enabled on the network interfaces listed in Table 7.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<table class="table">
 <caption>Table 7: Interfaces with ICMP redirects enabled</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Interface</th>
   <th>Description</th>
  </tr>

 <tbody>
<tr><td>Serial0/0/1</td><td>serial comm </td></tr>
<tr><td>FastEthernet0/1</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>FastEthernet0/2</td><td> </td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;<br>

<b>Impact:</b> An attacker could use ICMP redirect messages to route network traffic through their own router, possibly allowing them to monitor network traffic.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Tools are widely available that can send ICMP redirect messages.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if not required, ICMP redirects be disabled on all network interfaces. ICMP redirects can be disabled on each individual network interface using the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip redirects</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.16. <a name="sec_Logging">Logging</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Logging is an essential component of a secure network configuration. Logging not only assists network administrators to identify issues when troubleshooting, but enables network administrators to react to intrusion attempts or Denial-of-Service attacks. It is therefore critical that logs be monitored, allowing administrators to take immediate action when an attack has been identified. Furthermore, system logs are a key component of a forensic investigation into past intrusions or service disruptions.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that logging had not been configured on Router.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker could attempt to map and bypass any configured Access Control List (ACL) or to gain access to the Cisco Router without network administrators being alerted to the attempts. Furthermore, after an unauthorised intrusion into the network had been detected, it would be more difficult for an investigation to identify the source of the attack or the entry point without access to logs.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> N/A<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that Syslog and Buffered logging be configured on Router. Logging can be enabled with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging on</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
To configure Syslog logging, four things need to be set; a source interface for the Syslog messages to be sent from, one or more Syslog hosts to send messages to, the Syslog logging message severity level and the Syslog facility. The following commands can be used to configure Syslog logging:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging source-interface {<i>Interface</i>}</div>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging host {<i>Syslog IP address or hostname</i>}</div>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging trap {<i>Logging message severity level</i>}</div>&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging facility {<i>Syslog facility</i>}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
Buffered logging can be configured with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">logging buffered {<i>Buffer Size</i>} {<i>Logging message severity level</i>}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.17. <a name="sec_ProxyARP">Proxy ARP</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> ARP is a protocol that network hosts use to translate network addresses into media addresses. Under normal circumstances, ARP packets are confined to the sender's network segment. However, a Cisco router with Proxy ARP enabled on network interfaces can act as a proxy for ARP, responding to queries and acting as an intermediary.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper identified three interfaces that had Proxy ARP enabled. These are listed in Table 8.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<table class="table">
 <caption>Table 8: Interfaces with Proxy ARP enabled</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Interface</th>
   <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
 <tbody>
<tr><td>Serial0/0/1</td><td>serial comm </td></tr>
<tr><td>FastEthernet0/1</td><td> </td></tr>
<tr><td>FastEthernet0/2</td><td> </td></tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
&nbsp;<br>

<b>Impact:</b> A router that acts as a proxy for ARP requests will extend layer two access across multiple network segments, breaking perimeter security.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> A Cisco device with Proxy ARP enabled will proxy ARP requests for all hosts on those interfaces.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if not required, Proxy ARP be disabled on all interfaces. Proxy ARP can be disabled on each interface with the following Cisco IOS command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip proxy-arp</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.18. <a name="sec_CiscoDiscoveryProtocol">Cisco Discovery Protocol</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is a proprietary protocol that is primarily used by Cisco, but has been used by others. CDP allows some network management applications and CDP aware devices to identify each other on a Local Area Network (LAN) segment. Cisco devices, including switches, bridges and routers are configured to broadcast CDP packets by default. The devices can be configured to disable the CDP service or disable CDP on individual network interfaces.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that the CDP service had not been disabled, and additionally, had not been disabled on all the active network interfaces.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> CDP packets contain information about the sender, such as hardware model information, operating system version and IP address details. This information would allow an attacker to gain information about the configuration of the network infrastructure.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> CDP packets are broadcast to an entire network segment. An attacker could use one of the many publicly available tools to capture network traffic and view the leaked information.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if not required, the CDP service be disabled on the Cisco device Router. If CDP is required, Nipper recommends that CDP be disabled on all interfaces except those that are explicitly required.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
The CDP service can be disabled by issuing the following Cisco IOS command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no cdp run</div>&nbsp;<br>
CDP can be disabled on individual interfaces using the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no cdp enable</div>&nbsp;<br>
In some configurations with IP phones, deployed using either Auto Discovery or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), the CDP service may need to be enabled. In this situation CDP should be disabled on all network interfaces for which it is not required.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.19. <a name="sec_ClasslessRouting">Classless Routing</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Classless routing is enabled by default on Cisco routers. If a router has classless routing enabled and it receives a network packet for which there is no configured route, the router will forward the packet to the best destination. With classless routing disabled, the router would discard any network traffic for which no route is defined.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that classless routing was enabled on Router.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Network traffic that should not be routed by the router may be routed when classless routing is enabled.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> N/A<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if possible, classless routing be disabled. Classless routing can be disabled with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip classless</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.20. <a name="sec_IPUnreachables">IP Unreachables</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> ICMP IP unreachable messages can be generated by a Cisco device when a host attempts to connect to a non-existent host, network, or use an unsupported protocol. ICMP IP unreachable messages will let the connecting host know that the host, network or protocol is not supported or cannot be contacted. Therefore, the host does not have to wait for a connection time-out. ICMP IP unreachable messages are normally enabled by default on Cisco devices and must be explicitly disabled.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that the Cisco device Router had ICMP IP unreachable messages enabled on the interfaces listed in Table 9.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<table class="table">
 <caption>Table 9: Interfaces with IP unreachables enabled</caption>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th>Interface</th>
   <th>Description</th>

</table>
&nbsp;<br>

<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who was performing network scans to determine what services were available would be able to scan a device more quickly.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Tools are available on the Internet that can perform a wide variety of scan types.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if not required, IP unreachables be disabled on all network interfaces. However, whilst disabling IP unreachables will not stop scans, it does make it more difficult for an attacker. The IP unreachables option is disabled or enabled individually for each network interface. It can be disabled with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip unreachables</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.21. <a name="sec_ServicePasswordEncryption">Service Password Encryption</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Cisco service passwords are stored by default in their clear-text form rather than being encrypted. However, it is possible to have these passwords stored using the reversible Cisco type-7 encryption.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that the Cisco device Router was not running the password encryption service that helps provide a basic level of encryption to passwords that otherwise would be stored in clear-text.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> If a malicious user were to see a Cisco configuration that contained clear-text passwords, they could use the passwords to access the device. However, an attacker who had access to a Cisco configuration file would easily be able to reverse the passwords.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> Even though it is trivial to reverse Cisco type-7 passwords, they do provide a greater level of security than clear-text passwords. Tools are widely available on the Internet that reverse Cisco type-7 passwords.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that the Cisco password encryption service be enabled. The Cisco password encryption service can be started with the following Cisco IOS command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">service password-encryption</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.22. <a name="sec_LoginBanner">Login Banner</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> A banner message can be shown to users who connect to one of the remote management services, such as Telnet. Typically banner messages will include information on the law with regard to unauthorised access to the device, warning users who do not have the authority to access the device about the consequences.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that no login banner was configured.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Attackers who have gained access to a device could avoid legal action if no banner is configured to warn against unauthorised access.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> N/A<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that a banner be configured that warns against unauthorised access. Banners are configured on Cisco devices using a delimiter character. A delimiter character is specified in the banner command and is used again to mark the end of the banner. The Cisco command to add a login banner, that is presented to users prior to authentication, is:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">banner login {<i>delimiter</i>} <i>The banner text</i> {<i>delimiter</i>}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.23. <a name="sec_DomainLookups">Domain Lookups</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Cisco IOS-based devices support name lookups using the Domain Name System (DNS). However, if a DNS server has not been configured, then the DNS request is broadcast.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that name lookups had not been disabled and no DNS servers had been configured.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> An attacker who was able to capture network traffic could monitor DNS queries from the Cisco Router. Furthermore, Cisco devices can connect to Telnet servers by supplying only the hostname or IP address of the server. A mistyped Cisco command could be interpreted as an attempt to connect to a Telnet server and broadcast on the network.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> It would be trivial for an attacker to capture network traffic broadcast from a Cisco Router. Furthermore, network traffic capture tools are widely available on the Internet.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that domain lookups be disabled. Domain lookups can be disabled with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no ip domain-lookup</div>&nbsp;<br>
If domain lookups are required, Nipper recommends that DNS be configured. DNS can be configured with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">ip name-server {<i>IP address</i>}</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.24. <a name="sec_PacketAssembler/Disassembler">Packet Assembler / Disassembler</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> The Packet Assembler / Disassembler (PAD) service enables X.25 connections between network systems. The PAD service is enabled by default on most Cisco IOS devices but it is only required if support for X.25 links is necessary.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that the PAD service had not been disabled.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Running unused services increases the chances of an attacker finding a security hole or fingerprinting a device.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> N/A<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if not required, the PAD service be disabled. Use the following command to disable the PAD service:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no service pad</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.25. <a name="sec_MaintenanceOperationsProtocol">Maintenance Operations Protocol</a></h3>
<b>Observation:</b> Maintenance Operations Protocol (MOP) is used with the DECnet protocol suite. MOP is enabled by default on ethernet interfaces in some versions of IOS.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Nipper determined that MOP had not been disabled on all ethernet interfaces.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Impact:</b> Running unused services increases the chances of an attacker finding a security hole or fingerprinting a device.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Ease:</b> N/A<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<b>Recommendation:</b> Nipper recommends that, if not required, MOP be disabled on all ethernet interfaces. MOP can be disabled on each interface with the following command:<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<div class="command">no mop enabled</div><br>
&nbsp;<br>
<h3>2.26. <a name="sec_Conclusions">Conclusions</a></h3>

SNMP is used to assist network administrators in monitoring and managing a wide variety of network devices. There are three main versions of SNMP in use. Versions 1 and 2 of SNMP are both secured with a community string and authenticate and transmit network packets without any form of encryption. SNMP version 3 provides several levels of authentication and encryption. The most basic level provides a similar protection to that of the earlier protocol versions. However, SNMP version 3 can be configured to provide encrypted authentication (auth) and secured further with support for encrypted data communications (priv).<br>

<h3>3.10. <a name="con_Routing">Routing</a></h3>
A network device's routing tables can be configured with static routes or updated dynamically. Routing protocols are used by network routing devices to dynamically update the routing tables that devices use to forward network traffic to their destination. Router protocols can be split into two different categories; IGPs and Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs). IGPs are usually used in situations where the routing devices are all controlled by a single entity, such as within a company. EGPs are usually used in situations where routing devices are managed by a number of entities, such as the Internet. Typically routing devices support a number of standard routing protocols.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
VRRP is used to provide router load balancing and redundancy against a single point of failure. A VRRP master router will send advertisements to other routers in the same VRRP group. If the master VRRP router fails, the other routers in the VRRP group hold an election to determine which router will become the new master.<br>

RIP is an IGP and calculates routes using a distance vector. RIP is only suitable for small networks, routing updates are sent every 30 seconds and contain the entire routing table. Furthermore, RIP has a maximum distance of 15 hops. If RIP routes have not been updated within three minutes the route is marked as unusable. Routes not updated within four minutes are removed.<br>

EIGRP is an IGP and is a distance vector based protocol like RIP, but incorporates some features from link state protocols such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF). EIGRP was developed by Cisco as an enhanced version of IGRP. Unlike RIP, EIGRP transmits changes to network routes to its neighbors and is suitable for larger networks.<br>

OSPF protocol is an IGP. OSPF packets are sent when the network configuration changes, such as when a route goes down, and the packets only contain the change. Since the information sent in OSPF packets is limited to any network changes, the protocol is well suited to complex network configurations.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
For OSPF to work on a network interface it must be included within an OSPF network area.<br>

The Cisco line configuration settings are used to configure administrative access to the device. The console line type is used for accessing the Cisco device directly through a cable attached to the device's console port. The auxiliary lines are used for remote access to the device, typically through attached modems. The Virtual Teletype (VTY) lines are used for access to the device through a remote access service such as SSH or Telnet.<br>
