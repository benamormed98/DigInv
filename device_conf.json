        "intro":"Cisco Router devices routing tables can be configured with static routes or updated dynamically. Routing protocols are used by network routing devices to dynamically update the routing tables that devices use to forward network traffic to their destination. Routing protocols can be split into two different categories; Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs) and Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs). IGPs are usually used in situations where the routing devices are all controlled by a single entity, such as within a company. EGPs are usually used in situations where routing devices are managed by a number of entities, such as the Internet. Typically routing devices will support a number of standard routing protocols. This section describes the routing configuration settings.",

RIP is only suitable for small networks, routing updates are sent every 30 seconds and contain the entire routing table. Furthermore, RIP has a maximum distance of 15 hops. If RIP routes have not been updated within three minutes the route is marked as unusable. Routes not updated within four minutes are removed.",
