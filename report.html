    <h2>2.1.1 Security Issue Overview</h2>
    <p>Each security issue identified by DigInv is described with a finding, the impact of the issue, how easy it would be for an attacker to exploit the issue and a recommendation.</p>
    <h4>Issue Finding</h4>
    <p>The issue finding describes what DigInv identified during the security audit. Typically, the finding will include background information on what particular configuration settings are prior to describing what was found.</p>
    <h4>Issue Impact</h4>
    <p>The issue impact describes what an attacker could achieve from exploiting the security audit finding. However, it is worth noting that the impact of an issue can often be influenced by other configuration settings,         which could heighten or partially mitigate the issue. For example, a weak password could be partially         mitigated if the access gained from using it is restricted in some way.</p>
    <h4>Issue Ease</h4>
    <p>The issue ease describes the knowledge, skill, level of access and time scales that would be required by an attacker in order to exploit an issue. The issue ease will describe, where relevant, if any Open Source or commercially available tools could be used to exploit an issue.</p>
    <h4>Issue Recommandation</h4>
    <p>Each issue includes a recommendation section which describes the steps that DigInv recommends should be taken in order to mitigate the issue. The recommendation includes, where relevant, the commands that can be used to resolve the issue.</p>
    <h2>2.1.2 Rating System Overview</h2>
    <p>Each issue identified in the security audit is rated against both the impact of the issue and how easy it would be for an attacker to exploit. The fix rating provides a guide to the effort required to resolve the issue. The overall rating for the issue is calculated based on the issue's impact and ease ratings.</p>
    <h4>Impact Rating</h4>
    <p>An issue's impact rating is determined using the criteria outlined in the Table below.</p><table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>Rating</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>CRITICAL</td>
      <td>These issues can pose a very significant security threat. The issues that have a critical impact are typically those that would allow an attacker to gain full administrative access to the device. For a firewall device, allowing all traffic to pass through the device unfiltered would receive this rating as filtering traffic to protect other devices is the primary purpose of a firewall.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>HIGH</td>
      <td>These issues pose a significant threat to security, but have some limitations on the extent to which they can be abused. User level access to a device and a DoS vulnerability in a critical service would fall into this category. A firewall device that allowed significant unfiltered access, such as allowing entire subnets through or not filtering in all directions, would fall into this category. A router that allows significant modification of its routing configuration would also fall into this category.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>MEDIUM</td>
      <td>These issues have significant limitations on the direct impact they can cause. Typically, these issues would include significant information leakage issues, less significant DoS issues or those that provide significantly limited access. An SNMP service that is secured with a default or a dictionary-based community string would typically fall into this rating, as would a firewall that allows unfiltered access to a range of services on a device.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>LOW</td>
      <td>These issues represent a low level security threat. A typical issue would involve information leakage that could be useful to an attacker, such as a list of users or version details</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>INFORMATIONAL</td>
      <td>These issues represent a very low level of security threat. These issues include minor information leakage, unnecessary services or legacy protocols that present no real threat to security</td>

    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>TRIVIAL</td>
      <td>The issue requires little-to-no knowledge on behalf of an attacker and can be exploited using standard operating system tools. A firewall device which had a network filtering configuration that enables traffic to pass through would fall into this category.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>EASY</td>
      <td>The issue requires some knowledge for an attacker to exploit, which could be performed using standard operating system tools or tools downloaded from the Internet. An administrative service without or with a default password would fall into this category, as would a simple software vulnerability exploit.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>MODERATE</td>
      <td>The issue requires specific knowledge on behalf of an attacker. The issue could be exploited using a combination of operating system tools or publicly available tools downloaded from the Internet.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>CHALLENGE</td>
      <td>A security issue that falls into this category would require significant effort and knowledge on behalf of the attacker. The attacker may require specific physical access to resources or to the network infrastructure in order to successfully exploit the vulnerability. Furthermore, a combination of attacks may be required.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td>The issue is not directly exploitable. An issue such as enabling legacy protocols or unnecessary services would fall into this rating category.</td>

      <div class="container">
        <div class="information">
          <h3>1. Default SNMP Community Strings Were Configured</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>SNMP is an industry standard protocol for monitoring and managing a variety of devices. SNMP services typically offer detailed information that includes a device's operating system, network interfaces, memory, system counters and system users. Access to the SNMP Management Information Base (MIB) with protocol versions 1 and 2 is restricted using a community string to help prevent unauthorized access.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>With read access to the SNMP MIB an attacker would be able to enumerate a large quantity of information about the device, its configuration, network details and more. With write access to the SNMP MIB an attacker could reconfigure the device, potentially causing a DoS. Additionally, write access to SNMP on some devices would enable an attacker to download a copy of a device's configuration, including password hashes.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Default SNMP community strings are usually documented in the manufacturers manuals, on third-party Internet web sites and in the password dictionaries of testing tools. Furthermore, SNMP query tools are installed by default on some operating systems and other SNMP tools can be downloaded from the Internet.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that, if not required, SNMP should be disabled. If SNMP is required then DigInv recommends that only SNMP version 3 should be configured. If access using SNMP community strings is required, DigInv recommends that only strong community strings should be chosen that are also not used for any other authentication.
DigInv recommends that:SNMP community strings should be at least eight characters in length</li>
            <li> characters in the SNMP community string should not be repeated more than three times</li>
            <li> SNMP community strings should include both upper case and lower case characters</li>
            <li> SNMP community strings should include numbers</li>
            <li> SNMP community strings should include punctuation characters</li>
            <li> SNMP community strings should not include a device's name, make or model</li>
            <li> SNMP community strings should not be based on dictionary words.</li>

          <h3>2. UDP Small Services Enabled</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Some devices and platforms provide a collection of simple User Datagram Protocol (UDP) network services, which are also sometimes referred to Fix: Quick as small services. These services provide little functionality and are rarely used and they typically include:
Echo (defined in RFC 862) returns any data sent to it back to the connecting client;
Discard (defined in RFC 863) ignores any data sent to it by a connecting client;
Chargen (defined in RFC 864) generates printable characters which are returned to the connecting client.
DigInv determined that the UDP small servers were enabled</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker could use the UDP small servers as part of a DoS attack. UDP is a connection-less protocol and an experienced attacker could forge network packets to use the echo and chargen services to increase the network traffic and system utilization of devices offering the services. Additionally, each running service increases the chances of an attacker being able to identify the device and successfully compromise it. Although not as significant, some of the services may provide an attacker with simple information that could then be used as part of a targeted attack against the system.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Tools that can be used to connect to these services are installed by default on some systems or can be downloaded from the Internet.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that the UDP small servers should be disabled.</li>

          <h3>3. Clear-Text SNMP In Use</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>SNMP is an industry standard protocol for monitoring and managing a variety of devices. SNMP services typically offer detailed information that includes a device's operating system, network interfaces, memory, system counters and system users. With write access to SNMP, it is possible to re-configure networking, system properties and even shutdown a device. There are multiple versions of SNMP and versions prior to version 3 offer no encryption of either the authentication or data network traffic.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker or malicious user who can monitor the unencrypted SNMP network traffic would capture the SNMP community string used to authenticate access to the SNMP agent service. Additionally, they would capture all the information transferred using the unencrypted connection. With write access to SNMP an attacker could modify a device's settings and potentially cause a DoS condition.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Network packet capture tools can be downloaded from the Internet that can allow an attacker to monitor the network traffic. In a modern network environment, switches are typically deployed to connect the network infrastructure devices rather than hubs. With network switch devices, the attacker should only be able to see broadcast network traffic or traffic sent directly to or from the attacker's host. However, a skilled attacker could bypass this restriction by performing an attack such as ARP spoofing or exploiting a vulnerability with the network routing. Tools for bypassing a network switching environment's restrictions can be downloaded from the Internet. It is worth noting that with no SNMP view configured, the attacker would not be restricted to a specified subset of the SNMP MIB.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that, if not required, SNMP should be disabled. However, if SNMP access is required, DigInv recommends that only SNMP version 3 should be configured with strong authentication and privacy passwords.</li>

          <h3>4. No Inbound TCP Connection Keep-Alives</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>The keep-alive messages are used to determine if a connection is active or has become orphaned and is no longer used. Depending on the result, the device can reclaim resources allocated to inbound connections that have become orphaned. Connections to a device could become orphaned if a connection becomes disrupted or if the client has not properly terminated a connection.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker could attempt a DoS attack against a device by exhausting the number of possible connections. To perform this attack, the attacker could keep requesting new connections to the device and spoof the source IP addresses. This would then prevent any new legitimate connections to the device from being made as the device awaits the completion of the connection attempts that have already been initiated. This attack would prevent both users and administrators from connecting to the device.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Tools can be downloaded from the Internet that are capable of opening a large number of TCP connections without correctly terminating them.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that TCP keep alive messages should be sent to detect and drop orphaned connections from remote systems.</li>

          <h3>5. User Account Names Contained ADMIN</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>When User Account names contain admin, a clear indication is given to an attacker or malicous user that the account most likely has higher privilege levels than a standard user. This allows an attacker to focus their resources in a more direct way, such as targeted phishing attacks or other social engineering techniques.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>A malicious user would be able to create targeted phishing and social engineering attacks at a specific user they believe to have admin or elevated privileges. Once access is gained, they would have that user's access to a system, which could include re-configuring the device, extracting potentially sensitive information and disabling the device. Once an attacker has obtained the configuration from the device they may be able to identify authentication credentials that could then be used to gain access to other network devices.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Exploiting this vulnerability would require an attacker to have gained access to sensitive information detailing user accounts and associated ID's before being able to identify appropriate targets for phishing or social engineering attacks.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv strongly recommends that all Admin or elevated privilege accounts should not contain information that identifies them as being such.</li>

          <h3>6. Service Password Encryption Disabled</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Cisco service passwords are stored by default in their clear-text form rather than being encrypted. However, it is possible to have these passwords stored using the reversible Cisco type-7 encryption.
DigInv determined that the Cisco device Router was not running the password encryption service that helps provide a basic level of encryption to passwords that otherwise would be stored in clear-text.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>If a malicious user were to see a Cisco configuration that contained clear-text passwords, they could use the passwords to access the device. However, an attacker who had access to a Cisco configuration file would easily be able to reverse the passwords.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Even though it is trivial to reverse Cisco type-7 passwords, they do provide a greater level of security than clear-text passwords. Tools are widely available on the Internet that reverse Cisco type-7 passwords.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that the Cisco password encryption service be enabled. The Cisco password encryption service can be started with the following Cisco IOS command:</li>

          <h3>7. CDP enabled</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>CDP is a proprietary protocol that was developed and is primarily used by Cisco. A CDP enabled device can be configured to broadcast.
CDP packets on the network enabling network management applications and CDP aware devices to identify each other. CDP packets include information about thesender, such as OS version and IP address information.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>CDP packets contain information about the sender, such as hardware model information, operating system version and IP address details. This information would give an attacker valuable information about the device. The attacker could then use this information as part of a targeted attack.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>CDP packets are broadcast to an entire network segment. The attacker or malicious user would require access to a network segment on which the CDP packets are broadcast and network monitoring software. A wide variety of network monitoring, packet capture and analysis tools can be downloaded from the Internet.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that, if not required, CDP should be disabled.
In some configurations with IP phones, deployed using either Auto Discovery or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), the CDP service may need to be enabled. However, if the device supports disabling CDP on individual interfaces, then DigInv recommends that it should be disabled on all the interfaces where it is not required.</li>

          <h3>8. VTP Was In Server Mode</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>VTP was developed by Cisco to assist with the management of VLANs over multiple devices. The protocol enables the addition, renaming and deletion of VLANs on a single switch to be propagated to other network switches in the same VTP domain. A device in VTP server mode will transmit VTP packets containing VLAN information. If a device in VTP client mode in the same domain receives a VTP network packet with a higher revision number the changes will be applied.
 DigInv determined that VTP was in server mode.It is worth mentioning that although the VTP was found to be in server mode(adefault setting), no VTP domain was configured. However, there have been instances where a device in this configuration have had their VTP domain setremotely from other networked devices.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker could determine the VLAN configuration by capturing VTP packets sent from the device and VTP packets are not encrypted, even when a password is specified. The attacker could then use the VLAN information or password as part of a targeted attack.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>BOOTstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a datagram protocol that allows compatible hosts to load their operating system over the network from a BOOTP server. Cisco routers are capable of acting as BOOTP servers for other Cisco devices and the service is enabled by default. However, BOOTP is rarely used and may represent a security risk.
DigInv determined that BOOTP was not disabled. However, it is worth noting that not all Cisco devices support BOOTP.</p>

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>The Finger protocol (defined in RFC 749 and RFC 1288) enables the enumeration of status and user information from a system running a Finger service. The Finger protocol is simple and does not encrypt the data or provide any authentication. The default TCP port for the Finger service is 79.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker could use the Finger service to enumerate users and user information. The attacker could then use this information as part of a targeted attack such as password guessing or a brute-force attack. The Finger user information may also be used by an attacker for a targeted attack where user identity information would be useful.</li>

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Using SNMP, some network devices can be instructed to send its configuration to a file on a specified TFTP server. This feature enables network administrators and management software to quickly obtain a copy of a device's configuration. A network access list can be configured on those devices to help secure access to this functionality (supported on Cisco IOS devices from version 10.2).</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker who had SNMP write access could remotely obtain a copy of a device's configuration. The configuration would include any passwords for the device and include the configuration of the administrative services.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>For an attacker to exploit this issue they would require SNMP query tools, a TFTP server and a community string with write access to the SNMP MIB. SNMP query tools and TFTP server software can be downloaded from the Internet and some OS install them by default. If the attacker does not know the community string it may be possible to determine it by monitoring the network traffic or by brute-forcing the community string.</p>

          <p>Cisco IOS-based devices support name lookups using the Domain Name System (DNS). However, if a DNS server has not been configured, then the DNS request is broadcast.
DigInv determined that name lookups had not been disabled and no DNS servers had been configured.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker who was able to capture network traffic could monitor DNS queries from the Cisco Router.

          <h3>1. Clear-Text GLBP Group Authentication Was Configured</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>GLBP is a Cisco proprietary protocol used to provide router load balancing and redundancy against a single point of failure. GLBP routers are configured in a group which can be authenticated using either clear-text or MD5 authentication. Authentication is configured to ensure that routing will not be performed by an untrusted router.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker who is able to configure GLBP with the relevant authentication configuration in order to become the AVG would be able to control network routing in order to: monitor network traffic sent between network segments</li>
            <li> perform a man in the middle attack</li>
            <li> capture clear-text protocol authentication credentials</li>
            <li> capture encrypted authentication hashes which could be subjected to a brute-force attack</li>
            <li> perform a network wide DoS</li>
            <li> route updates could be redistributed by the device to other routing devices and possibly using other routing protocols and authentication.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>An attacker could use a GLBP capable device in the attack. The attacker could then configure their GLBP capable device to be in the same group to become a network router. The authentication key can be configured using a GLBP packet captured from the network.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that all enable passwords should be stored using the MD5 hash</li>

          <h3>1. Not All EIGRP Updates Were Authenticated</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>EIGRP is a routing protocol that allows network devices to dynamically adapt to changes to the network topology. EIGRP supports authentication using either clear-text or MD5 authentication methods. This ensures that routing updates are sent from a trusted source.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker may attempt to modify the routing table of a EIGRP routing device in an attempt to route network traffic through a device that they control. If an attacker is able to control a routing device they would be able to: monitor network traffic sent between network segments</li>
            <li> perform a man in the middle attack</li>
            <li> capture clear-text protocol authentication credentials</li>
            <li> capture encrypted authentication hashes which could be subjected to a brute-force attack</li>
            <li> perform a network wide DoS</li>
            <li> route updates could be redistributed by the device to other routing devices and possibly using other routing protocols and authentication.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Tools can be downloaded from the Internet that can be used to send malicious EIGRP routing updates. With no authentication configured, an attacker would not have to determine the authentication key prior to sending malicious EIGRP route updates.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Generally the SNMP system shutdown facility is not saved to the configuration file and should not persist following a system shutdown.DigInv recommends that the SNMP system shutdown facility should be disabled.</li>
