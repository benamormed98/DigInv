    <h2>2.1.1 Security Issue Overview</h2>
    <p>Each security issue identified by DigInv is described with a finding, the impact of the issue, how easy it would be for an attacker to exploit the issue and a recommendation.</p>
    <h4>Issue Finding</h4>
    <p>The issue finding describes what DigInv identified during the security audit. Typically, the finding will include background information on what particular configuration settings are prior to describing what was found.</p>
    <h4>Issue Impact</h4>
    <p>The issue impact describes what an attacker could achieve from exploiting the security audit finding. However, it is worth noting that the impact of an issue can often be influenced by other configuration settings,         which could heighten or partially mitigate the issue. For example, a weak password could be partially         mitigated if the access gained from using it is restricted in some way.</p>
    <h4>Issue Ease</h4>
    <p>The issue ease describes the knowledge, skill, level of access and time scales that would be required by an attacker in order to exploit an issue. The issue ease will describe, where relevant, if any Open Source or commercially available tools could be used to exploit an issue.</p>
    <h4>Issue Recommandation</h4>
    <p>Each issue includes a recommendation section which describes the steps that DigInv recommends should be taken in order to mitigate the issue. The recommendation includes, where relevant, the commands that can be used to resolve the issue.</p>
    <h2>2.1.2 Rating System Overview</h2>
    <p>Each issue identified in the security audit is rated against both the impact of the issue and how easy it would be for an attacker to exploit. The fix rating provides a guide to the effort required to resolve the issue. The overall rating for the issue is calculated based on the issue's impact and ease ratings.</p>
    <h4>Impact Rating</h4>
    <p>An issue's impact rating is determined using the criteria outlined in the Table below.</p><table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>
      <th>Rating</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>CRITICAL</td>
      <td>These issues can pose a very significant security threat. The issues that have a critical impact are typically those that would allow an attacker to gain full administrative access to the device. For a firewall device, allowing all traffic to pass through the device unfiltered would receive this rating as filtering traffic to protect other devices is the primary purpose of a firewall.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>HIGH</td>
      <td>These issues pose a significant threat to security, but have some limitations on the extent to which they can be abused. User level access to a device and a DoS vulnerability in a critical service would fall into this category. A firewall device that allowed significant unfiltered access, such as allowing entire subnets through or not filtering in all directions, would fall into this category. A router that allows significant modification of its routing configuration would also fall into this category.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>MEDIUM</td>
      <td>These issues have significant limitations on the direct impact they can cause. Typically, these issues would include significant information leakage issues, less significant DoS issues or those that provide significantly limited access. An SNMP service that is secured with a default or a dictionary-based community string would typically fall into this rating, as would a firewall that allows unfiltered access to a range of services on a device.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>LOW</td>
      <td>These issues represent a low level security threat. A typical issue would involve information leakage that could be useful to an attacker, such as a list of users or version details</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>INFORMATIONAL</td>
      <td>These issues represent a very low level of security threat. These issues include minor information leakage, unnecessary services or legacy protocols that present no real threat to security</td>
    </tr>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>TRIVIAL</td>
      <td>The issue requires little-to-no knowledge on behalf of an attacker and can be exploited using standard operating system tools. A firewall device which had a network filtering configuration that enables traffic to pass through would fall into this category.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>EASY</td>
      <td>The issue requires some knowledge for an attacker to exploit, which could be performed using standard operating system tools or tools downloaded from the Internet. An administrative service without or with a default password would fall into this category, as would a simple software vulnerability exploit.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>MODERATE</td>
      <td>The issue requires specific knowledge on behalf of an attacker. The issue could be exploited using a combination of operating system tools or publicly available tools downloaded from the Internet.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>CHALLENGE</td>
      <td>A security issue that falls into this category would require significant effort and knowledge on behalf of the attacker. The attacker may require specific physical access to resources or to the network infrastructure in order to successfully exploit the vulnerability. Furthermore, a combination of attacks may be required.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td>The issue is not directly exploitable. An issue such as enabling legacy protocols or unnecessary services would fall into this rating category.</td>

      <td>INVOLVED</td>
      <td>The resolution of the issue will require significant resources to resolve and is likely to include disruption to network services, and possibly the modification of other network device configurations. The issue could involve upgrading a device's OS and possible modifications to the hardware.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>PLANNED</td>
      <td>The issue resolution involves planning, testing and could cause some disruption to services. This issue could involve changes to routing protocols and changes to network filtering.</td>

          <h3>1. Warning In Pre-Logon Banner</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Logon banner messages are an important, but often overlooked, part of a secure configuration. Logon banner messages can provide connecting users with important information and warn against unauthorized access.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>A carefully worded warning message could deter a casual attacker or malicious user, but not a determined attacker. However, it would be more difficult to prove any intent without a message warning against unauthorized access if any legal action were to be taken against an attacker.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>An attacker would not be presented with a carefully worded legal warning prior to attempting to logon.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that all pre-logon banner messages should be configured to warn against unauthorized access.</li>

          <h3>2. No Network Filtering Rules Were Configured</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Network filtering can be configured to restrict access to network services from only those hosts that require the access, helping to prevent unauthorized access. When configured, network filter rules are processed sequentially and the first rule in the filter rule list which matches the network packet is applied.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Typically firewall appliances will drop network traffic if there are no network filtering rules configured. Whereas most non-firewall appliances will usually allow all network traffic if no network filtering rules have been configured. Although no network filter rules had been configured the default action was to drop the all network packets. Therefore an attacker, or malicious user, would not be able to access network services as all network traffic would be blocked.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>No specialist skills or tools are required by the attacker to exploit this issue.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that network filter rules should be configured to help prevent unauthorized access to network services.DigInv recommends that: filter rules should only allow access to specific destination addresses</li>
            <li> filter rules should only allow access to specific destination network ports</li>
            <li> filter rules should only allow access from specific source addresses</li>

          <h3>3. No Post Logon Banner Message</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Post logon banner messages are ones that are shown to users after they have authenticated and prior to being given access to the device. It is one that is shown to users when they connect to a device and prior to the user logon.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>The post logon banner is useful for detailing the acceptable use policy and the change control procedures which should be followed prior to making any changes to a device's configuration. An acceptable use message detailing the change control procedures and waning against abuse of the policy could help to prevent ad- hoc changes being made to a device's configuration. Additionally, if a device does not have the facilities to configure a pre-logon banner message then the post logon banner message could be the only place where a legal warning against unauthorized access could be given.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>With no post logon banner configured, a user would not be given a reminder of the acceptable use and change control procedure policy details.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that a post logon banner message is configured that details both the acceptable use policy and change control procedures. Additionally, if the device does not support a pre-logon banner message then DigInv recommends that the post logon banner message should also include a carefully worded legal warning against unauthorized access.</li>

          <h3>4. Connection Timeout not configured</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Connection timeouts can be configured for a number of the device services. If a timeout were configured on an administrative service, an administrator that did not correctly terminate the connection would have it automatically closed after the timeout expires. However, if a timeout is not configured, or is configured to be a long timeout, an unauthorised user may be able to gain access using the administrator's previously logged-in connection.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker who was able to gain access to a connection that had not expired, would be able to continue using that connection. A connection could be a console port on the device that was not correctly terminated or a remote administrative connection.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>The attacker would have to gain physical access to the device to use the console port, or gain remote access to an administration machine that is attached to the port. To gain access to remote connections, an attacker would have to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the device. The attacker would then have to take over the connection, which could be very difficult with some services. Tools are available on the Internet that would facilitate the monitoring of network connections.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that domain lookups be disabled. Domain lookups can be disabled with the following command:</li>

          <h3>1. Connection Timeout not configured</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Connection timeouts can be configured for a number of the device services. If a timeout were configured on an administrative service, an administrator that did not correctly terminate the connection would have it automatically closed after the timeout expires. However, if a timeout is not configured, or is configured to be a long timeout, an unauthorised user may be able to gain access using the administrator's previously logged-in connection.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker who was able to gain access to a connection that had not expired, would be able to continue using that connection. A connection could be a console port on the device that was not correctly terminated or a remote administrative connection.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>The attacker would have to gain physical access to the device to use the console port, or gain remote access to an administration machine that is attached to the port. To gain access to remote connections, an attacker would have to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the device. The attacker would then have to take over the connection, which could be very difficult with some services. Tools are available on the Internet that would facilitate the monitoring of network connections.</p>

          <p>A vulnerability in the web services interface of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct directory traversal attacks and read sensitive files on a targeted system. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input validation of URLs in HTTP requests processed by an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request containing directory traversal character sequences to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view arbitrary files within the web services file system on the targeted device. The web services file system is enabled when the affected device is configured with either WebVPN or AnyConnect features. This vulnerability cannot be used to obtain access to ASA or FTD system files or underlying operating system (OS) files.</p>
