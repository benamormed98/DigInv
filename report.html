    <h2>2.1.1 Security Issue Overview</h2>
    <p>Each security issue identified by DigInv is described with a finding, the impact of the issue, how easy it would be for an attacker to exploit the issue and a recommendation.</p>
    <h4>Issue Finding</h4>
    <p>The issue finding describes what DigInv identified during the security audit. Typically, the finding will include background information on what particular configuration settings are prior to describing what was found.</p>
    <h4>Issue Impact</h4>
    <p>The issue impact describes what an attacker could achieve from exploiting the security audit finding. However, it is worth noting that the impact of an issue can often be influenced by other configuration settings,         which could heighten or partially mitigate the issue. For example, a weak password could be partially         mitigated if the access gained from using it is restricted in some way.</p>
    <h4>Issue Ease</h4>
    <p>The issue ease describes the knowledge, skill, level of access and time scales that would be required by an attacker in order to exploit an issue. The issue ease will describe, where relevant, if any Open Source or commercially available tools could be used to exploit an issue.</p>
    <h4>Issue Recommandation</h4>
    <p>Each issue includes a recommendation section which describes the steps that DigInv recommends should be taken in order to mitigate the issue. The recommendation includes, where relevant, the commands that can be used to resolve the issue.</p>
    <h2>2.1.2 Rating System Overview</h2>
    <p>Each issue identified in the security audit is rated against both the impact of the issue and how easy it would be for an attacker to exploit. The fix rating provides a guide to the effort required to resolve the issue. The overall rating for the issue is calculated based on the issue's impact and ease ratings.</p>
    <h4>Impact Rating</h4>
    <p>An issue's impact rating is determined using the criteria outlined in the Table below.</p><table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th></th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>CRITICAL</td>
      <td>These issues can pose a very significant security threat. The issues that have a critical impact are typically those that would allow an attacker to gain full administrative access to the device. For a firewall device, allowing all traffic to pass through the device unfiltered would receive this rating as filtering traffic to protect other devices is the primary purpose of a firewall.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>HIGH</td>
      <td>These issues pose a significant threat to security, but have some limitations on the extent to which they can be abused. User level access to a device and a DoS vulnerability in a critical service would fall into this category. A firewall device that allowed significant unfiltered access, such as allowing entire subnets through or not filtering in all directions, would fall into this category. A router that allows significant modification of its routing configuration would also fall into this category.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>MEDIUM</td>
      <td>These issues have significant limitations on the direct impact they can cause. Typically, these issues would include significant information leakage issues, less significant DoS issues or those that provide significantly limited access. An SNMP service that is secured with a default or a dictionary-based community string would typically fall into this rating, as would a firewall that allows unfiltered access to a range of services on a device.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>LOW</td>
      <td>These issues represent a low level security threat. A typical issue would involve information leakage that could be useful to an attacker, such as a list of users or version details</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>INFORMATIONAL</td>
      <td>These issues represent a very low level of security threat. These issues include minor information leakage, unnecessary services or legacy protocols that present no real threat to security</td>

    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>TRIVIAL</td>
      <td>The issue requires little-to-no knowledge on behalf of an attacker and can be exploited using standard operating system tools. A firewall device which had a network filtering configuration that enables traffic to pass through would fall into this category.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>EASY</td>
      <td>The issue requires some knowledge for an attacker to exploit, which could be performed using standard operating system tools or tools downloaded from the Internet. An administrative service without or with a default password would fall into this category, as would a simple software vulnerability exploit.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>MODERATE</td>
      <td>The issue requires specific knowledge on behalf of an attacker. The issue could be exploited using a combination of operating system tools or publicly available tools downloaded from the Internet.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>CHALLENGE</td>
      <td>A security issue that falls into this category would require significant effort and knowledge on behalf of the attacker. The attacker may require specific physical access to resources or to the network infrastructure in order to successfully exploit the vulnerability. Furthermore, a combination of attacks may be required.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>N/A</td>

          <h3>1. Users With Dictionary-Based Passwords</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Access to restricted network user and administration services are typically secured using username and password authentication credentials. The strength of the authentication credentials is even more important if the service allows for devices to be reconfigured or it allows access to potentially sensitive information.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>A malicious user, or remote attacker, who is able to connect to an administrative service will be able to perform a dictionary-based attack in order to identify valid authentication credentials and logon to the device. The attacker will then be able to perform administrative and user level tasks. This could include re- configuring the device, extracting potentially sensitive information and disabling the device. Once an attacker has obtained the configuration from the device they may be able to identify authentication credentials that could then be used to gain access to other network devices.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Dictionary-based password guessing attacks have been widely documented on the Internet and published media, enabling an attacker with very little knowledge or experience to perform the attack. There are a number of different dictionary-based password guessing tools and password dictionaries available on the Internet. Additionally an experienced attacker is likely to have a collection of personal password dictionaries which they have built up over time. However, there are a number of factors that may discourage an attacker from performing a dictionary-based attack. ;Account lockout facilities can quickly prevent access to the account. ;Device protection mechanisms may slow or disconnect connections where multiple authentication attempts are made in a short period of time. ;Brute-forcing can be very time consuming, especially if the password is long or made up of various character types. ;Network administrators may be alerted to locked out accounts or authentication attempts.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that: passwords should be at least eight characters in length</li>
            <li> characters in the password should not be repeated more than three times</li>
            <li> passwords should include both upper case and lower case characters</li>
            <li> passwords should include numbers</li>
            <li> passwords should include punctuation characters</li>
            <li> passwords should not include the username</li>
            <li> passwords should not include a device's name, make or model</li>

          <h3>2. Default SNMP Community Strings Were Configured</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>SNMP is an industry standard protocol for monitoring and managing a variety of devices. SNMP services typically offer detailed information that includes a device's operating system, network interfaces, memory, system counters and system users. Access to the SNMP Management Information Base (MIB) with protocol versions 1 and 2 is restricted using a community string to help prevent unauthorized access.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>With read access to the SNMP MIB an attacker would be able to enumerate a large quantity of information about the device, its configuration, network details and more. With write access to the SNMP MIB an attacker could reconfigure the device, potentially causing a DoS. Additionally, write access to SNMP on some devices would enable an attacker to download a copy of a device's configuration, including password hashes.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Default SNMP community strings are usually documented in the manufacturers manuals, on third-party Internet web sites and in the password dictionaries of testing tools. Furthermore, SNMP query tools are installed by default on some operating systems and other SNMP tools can be downloaded from the Internet.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that, if not required, SNMP should be disabled. If SNMP is required then DigInv recommends that only SNMP version 3 should be configured. If access using SNMP community strings is required, DigInv recommends that only strong community strings should be chosen that are also not used for any other authentication.
DigInv recommends that:SNMP community strings should be at least eight characters in length</li>
            <li> characters in the SNMP community string should not be repeated more than three times</li>
            <li> SNMP community strings should include both upper case and lower case characters</li>
            <li> SNMP community strings should include numbers</li>
            <li> SNMP community strings should include punctuation characters</li>

          <h3>3. UDP Small Services Enabled</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Some devices and platforms provide a collection of simple User Datagram Protocol (UDP) network services, which are also sometimes referred to Fix: Quick as small services. These services provide little functionality and are rarely used and they typically include:
Echo (defined in RFC 862) returns any data sent to it back to the connecting client;
Discard (defined in RFC 863) ignores any data sent to it by a connecting client;
Chargen (defined in RFC 864) generates printable characters which are returned to the connecting client.
DigInv determined that the UDP small servers were enabled</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker could use the UDP small servers as part of a DoS attack. UDP is a connection-less protocol and an experienced attacker could forge network packets to use the echo and chargen services to increase the network traffic and system utilization of devices offering the services. Additionally, each running service increases the chances of an attacker being able to identify the device and successfully compromise it. Although not as significant, some of the services may provide an attacker with simple information that could then be used as part of a targeted attack against the system.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Tools that can be used to connect to these services are installed by default on some systems or can be downloaded from the Internet.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that the UDP small servers should be disabled.</li>

          <h3>4. Clear-Text SNMP In Use</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>SNMP is an industry standard protocol for monitoring and managing a variety of devices. SNMP services typically offer detailed information that includes a device's operating system, network interfaces, memory, system counters and system users. With write access to SNMP, it is possible to re-configure networking, system properties and even shutdown a device. There are multiple versions of SNMP and versions prior to version 3 offer no encryption of either the authentication or data network traffic.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker or malicious user who can monitor the unencrypted SNMP network traffic would capture the SNMP community string used to authenticate access to the SNMP agent service. Additionally, they would capture all the information transferred using the unencrypted connection. With write access to SNMP an attacker could modify a device's settings and potentially cause a DoS condition.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Network packet capture tools can be downloaded from the Internet that can allow an attacker to monitor the network traffic. In a modern network environment, switches are typically deployed to connect the network infrastructure devices rather than hubs. With network switch devices, the attacker should only be able to see broadcast network traffic or traffic sent directly to or from the attacker's host. However, a skilled attacker could bypass this restriction by performing an attack such as ARP spoofing or exploiting a vulnerability with the network routing. Tools for bypassing a network switching environment's restrictions can be downloaded from the Internet. It is worth noting that with no SNMP view configured, the attacker would not be restricted to a specified subset of the SNMP MIB.</p>

          <h3>5. No HTTP Server Session Timeout</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>The HTTP server session timeout setting is used to determine if a web session is no longer being used, enabling a device to determine when a connection can be automatically disconnected. A HTTP server session could become unused if an administrator has not properly terminated a connection and remains authenticated, such as when a user does not click on a logout button. The session could also become unused if the user leaves their computer unattended without terminating the session.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>If an attacker was able to access a system using an authenticated session that is no longer being used, the attacker would be able to perform information gathering, configuration and other malicious activities under the context of the previous authenticated user. The level of access could potentially be at an administrative level.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>To exploit this issue an attacker would first have to identify a working HTTP server session, possibly prior to it becoming unused by the user, and then be able to control that web session. This may be as simple as using the users computer whilst they are away, otherwise the attacker may have to exploit a weakness in the protocol or perform a man-in-the-middle attack. The man-in-the-middle attack could be performed using a proxy server, but a user could become suspicious if the session is using Hypertext Transfer Protocol over SSL (HTTPS) and the web browser provides the user with a certificate warning.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>When User Account names contain admin, a clear indication is given to an attacker or malicous user that the account most likely has higher privilege levels than a standard user. This allows an attacker to focus their resources in a more direct way, such as targeted phishing attacks or other social engineering techniques.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>A malicious user would be able to create targeted phishing and social engineering attacks at a specific user they believe to have admin or elevated privileges. Once access is gained, they would have that user's access to a system, which could include re-configuring the device, extracting potentially sensitive information and disabling the device. Once an attacker has obtained the configuration from the device they may be able to identify authentication credentials that could then be used to gain access to other network devices.</li>

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>User passwords on Cisco IOS-based devices can be configured to store user passwords using either a MD5 password hash or using the Cisco Type 7 password encoding algorithm. Whilst the Cisco Type-7 password encoding can be easily reversed to reveal the original password, MD5 hashes can not be reversed. Instead if the original password needs to be determined from an MD5 hash, the passwords must be guessed and then put through the MD5 hashing process. The resulting MD5 hashes can then be compared in order to determine if the passwords match.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>A strong password stored using an MD5 hash can take a significant period of time to brute-force. However, the same password stored in Cisco Type 7 form can be reversed in a fraction of a second. An attacker could use decoded passwords from a Cisco device in order to gain a level of access to the device and potentially modify its configuration.</li>

          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>An attacker who had access to the Cisco configuration file would easily be able to retrieve and decode passwords that are stored using the Cisco type-7 encoding scheme. However, an attacker who had access to a Cisco configuration file could attempt a brute-force attack against the stronger MD5 hashes. Tools can be downloaded from the Internet that are capable of reversing Cisco Type 7 passwords. However, an attacker would need to obtain a copy of the configuration file and would need to be able to gain initial access to the device before they could make use of an enable password.</p>

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>The Auxilary (AUX) port's primary purpose is to provide a remote administration capability. With a modem connected to the AUX port, a remote administrator could dial into the device in order to perform remote administration. As an extra layer of security, some devices can be configured with a callback facility. The callback facility, if configured, drops any incoming calls and dials the network administrator back.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>If an attacker is able to dial in and connect to the device remotely using the AUX port, the attacker could perform a brute-force attack against the authentication mechanism in order to gain remote administrative access. If a malicious user was able to gain physical access to a device where the AUX port had not been disabled, they could attach a modem in order to perform an attack from a remote location. If a callback facility has not been configured, then the device would not drop incoming calls and attempt to dial the network administrators phone number.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>In order to successfully exploit this issue, the attacker would require a modem to be attached to the AUX port. If a modem is already attached, an attacker could discover the modem's telephone number during a war-dial.

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>HTTP (RFC 2616) provides web-based services, such as information services, network device administration and other potentially sensitive services. HTTP provides no encryption of the connection between the client and server including any authentication and data transfer. HTTPS, which is HTTP over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)/TLS, is used to provide cryptographically secure web-based connection. Network access to the HTTP service can be restricted by specifying those hosts that are allowed to access the service and thereby denying access to all other network host addresses.</p>

          <ul>
            <li>Without management host address restrictions an attacker, or malicious user, with authentication credentials would be able to connect to the HTTPS service, logon and access the functionality and information provided for that user. If an attacker does not have authentication credentials they could attempt a brute- force attack in order to identify valid credentials. Additionally, if there is a vulnerability with the service then allowing anyone to connect to the service could enable an attacker to exploit the vulnerability.</li>

          <p>Time synchronization for network devices is inherently important, not just for the various services that make use of time, but also for the accurate logging of events. Therefore network devices can be configured to synchronize their time against a network time source in order to ensure that the time is synchronized. NTP (described in RFC 5905) is a complex time synchronization protocol with a number of different features and options. In addition to time, a number of control queries can be made to an NTP server, these include requesting a list of the servers NTP peers and a number of different variables.</p>

          <p>VTP was developed by Cisco to assist with the management of VLANs over multiple devices. The protocol enables the addition, renaming and deletion of VLANs on a single switch to be propagated to other network switches in the same VTP domain. A device in VTP server mode will transmit VTP packets containing VLAN information. If a device in VTP client mode in the same domain receives a VTP network packet with a higher revision number the changes will be applied.
 DigInv determined that VTP was in server mode.It is worth mentioning that although the VTP was found to be in server mode(adefault setting), no VTP domain was configured.

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>BOOTstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a datagram protocol that allows compatible hosts to load their operating system over the network from a BOOTP server. Cisco routers are capable of acting as BOOTP servers for other Cisco devices and the service is enabled by default. However, BOOTP is rarely used and may represent a security risk.
DigInv determined that BOOTP was not disabled. However, it is worth noting that not all Cisco devices support BOOTP.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker could use the BOOTP service to download a copy of the router's IOS software.</li>

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>The Finger protocol (defined in RFC 749 and RFC 1288) enables the enumeration of status and user information from a system running a Finger service. The Finger protocol is simple and does not encrypt the data or provide any authentication. The default TCP port for the Finger service is 79.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker could use the Finger service to enumerate users and user information. The attacker could then use this information as part of a targeted attack such as password guessing or a brute-force attack.

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Using SNMP, some network devices can be instructed to send its configuration to a file on a specified TFTP server. This feature enables network administrators and management software to quickly obtain a copy of a device's configuration. A network access list can be configured on those devices to help secure access to this functionality (supported on Cisco IOS devices from version 10.2).</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker who had SNMP write access could remotely obtain a copy of a device's configuration. The configuration would include any passwords for the device and include the configuration of the administrative services.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>For an attacker to exploit this issue they would require SNMP query tools, a TFTP server and a community string with write access to the SNMP MIB. SNMP query tools and TFTP server software can be downloaded from the Internet and some OS install them by default. If the attacker does not know the community string it may be possible to determine it by monitoring the network traffic or by brute-forcing the community string.</p>

          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Strong authentication credentials are a key component of a systems security. It is therefore important that a user chooses a strong password and that it is changed on a regular basis.

          <h3>22. Clear Text HTTP Service Enabled</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>HTTP (RFC 2616) provides web-based services, such as information services, network device administration and other potentially sensitive services. HTTP provides no encryption of the connection between the client and server including any authentication and data transfer.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Due to the lack of encryption provided by the HTTP service, an attacker who is able to monitor a session would be able to view all of the authentication credentials and data passed in the session. The attacker could then attempt to gain access to the device using the authentication credentials extracted from the session and potentially gain access under the context of that user. Since HTTP is commonly used for network device administration this could gain the attacker an administrative level of access.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>To exploit the fact that the HTTP service does not provide any encryption, the attacker would need to be able to monitor the session between a HTTP server and web browser. In some situations the attacker may not need to perform any further action other than launching a network monitoring tool. However, in a switched network the attacker may need to perform additional actions such as an ARP attack and in a routed environment the attacker may have to compromise the network routing.Tools that are capable of both monitoring and displaying network traffic in an easy to read form can be downloaded from the Internet. There are also tools that automatically detect where authentication credentials or files are being transferred and display or save the data. Tools are also available that enable an attacker to easily perform a variety of network attacks in order to be able to monitor and intercept sessions between two network devices.</p>

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Some devices and platforms provide a collection of simple TCP network services, which are also sometimes referred to as small services. These services provide little functionality and are rarely used and they typically include:Echo (defined in RFC 862) returns any data sent to it back to the connecting client;Discard (defined in RFC 863) ignores any data sent to it by a connecting client;Chargen (defined in RFC 864) generates printable characters which are returned to the connecting client;Daytime (defined in RFC 867) returns the current time to a connecting client.DigInv determined that the TCP small servers were enabled</p>

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Time synchronization for network devices is inherently important, not just for the various services that make use of time, but also for the accurate logging of events. Therefore network devices can be configured to synchronize their time against a network time source in order to ensure that the time is synchronized. NTP (described in RFC 5905) is a complex time synchronization protocol with a number of different features and options. In addition to time, a number of control queries can be made to an NTP server, these include requesting a list of the servers NTP peers and a number of different variables.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>If an attacker is able to modify a device's time with an inaccurate time update then it would be more difficult during an examination to correlate the system logs.

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>IP is a routing protocol that allows network devices to dynamically adapt to changes in the network infrastructure. There are three main versions of RIP: version 1 of the protocol, outlined in RFC 1058, supports simple routing updates with support only for classful routing and broadcast updates;version 2 of the protocol, outlined in RFC 2453, added support for Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), authentication (both in clear-text and MD5 forms) and multicast updates; NG, outlined in RFC 2080, adds support for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) but does not include support for authentication.</p>

            <li> route updates could be redistributed by the device to other routing devices and possibly using other routing protocols and authentication. Another issue with RIP version 1, though not necessarily a security one, is that broadcast updates can wake up computers that are shutdown on the Local Area Network (LAN).</li>

          <h3>1. Clear-Text OSPF Authentication Was Configured</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>OSPF is a routing protocol that allows network devices to dynamically adapt to changes to the network topology. OSPF supports authentication using either clear-text or MD5 authentication methods. This ensures that routing updates are sent from a trusted source.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker may attempt to modify the routing table of a routing device in an attempt to route network traffic through a device that they control. If an attacker is able to control a routing device they would be able to: monitor network traffic sent between network segments</li>
            <li> perform a man in the middle attack</li>
            <li> capture clear-text protocol authentication credentials</li>
            <li> capture encrypted authentication hashes which could be subjected to a brute-force attack</li>
            <li> perform a network wide DoS</li>
            <li> route updates could be redistributed by the device to other routing devices and possibly using other routing protocols and authentication.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Tools can be downloaded from the Internet that can be used to send malicious OSPF routing updates. With no authentication configured, an attacker would not have to determine the authentication key prior to sending malicious OSPF route updates.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that strong OSPF authentication keys should be configured for all routing updates. DigInv recommends that: OSPF authentication keys should be at least eight characters in length</li>
            <li> characters in the OSPF authentication key should not be repeated more than three times</li>
            <li> OSPF authentication keys should include both upper case and lower case characters</li>

          <h3>1. Low VRRP Router Priorities</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>VRRP is an industry standard protocol used to provide router redundancy against a single point of failure. Multiple routers can be configured in a VRRP group in a master and backup router configuration. The master router is determined by an election where the router with the highest priority will become the master. Router priorities can be between 1 and 254.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker who is able to configure VRRP with the relevant authentication configuration, could configure a higher priority and force a router election in order to become the master router. If an attacker is able to control a routing device they would be able to: monitor network traffic sent between network segments</li>
            <li> perform a man in the middle attack</li>

            <li> route updates could be redistributed by the device to other routing devices and possibly using other routing protocols and authentication.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>To perform this attack, the attacker would first have to determine the existing VRRP configuration. If authentication credentials are used, the attacker could extract them from the captured network packets. With MD5-based authentication, the attacker would have use a dictionary/brute-force attack in order to determine the authentication key. Additionally, the attacker would require access to a network segment where they could participate in VRRP routing. The attacker could then configure their router with a higher priority in order to perform the attack. All of the software required to complete each of these components can be downloaded from the Internet.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>

          <h3>1. Weak HSRP Group Authentication Keys</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>HSRP is a Cisco proprietary protocol used to provide router redundancy against a single point of failure. HSRP routers are configured in a group which can be authenticated using either clear-text or MD5 authentication.

          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker may attempt to join a HSRP routing group and become the master router. If an attacker is able to become a router, they would be able to: monitor network traffic sent between network segments</li>
            <li> perform a man in the middle attack</li>
            <li> capture clear-text protocol authentication credentials</li>
            <li> capture encrypted authentication hashes which could be subjected to a brute-force attack</li>
            <li> perform a network wide DoS</li>
            <li> route updates could be redistributed by the device to other routing devices and possibly using other routing protocols and authentication.</li>

          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>For a clear-text HSRP group authentication, the attacker could monitor the network traffic in order to gain the HSRP group authentication key. For MD5 authentication, an attacker could perform a brute force attack. This can be achieved using software downloaded from the Internet. An attacker could use a HSRP capable device, or download HSRP software from the Internet. The attacker could then configure their HSRP to be in the same group and with a higher priority in order to become the master during an election.

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Routers and routing devices can be configured to send route updates to each other. This enables devices to dynamically adapt to changes in the network topology and enables router devices to make informed decisions when routing network traffic between networks. Authentication keys, sometimes referred to as shared secrets, can be configured for routing protocols. The routing protocol authentication keys are configured to ensure that any routing updates sent to the device that will update the device's routing information were only sent from trusted sources.</p>

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>OSPF is a routing protocol that can be configured to dynamically update the routing table with changes to the network topology. Multiple routers can be configured on a network for fault tolerance, in that situation the router with the highest priority will take precedence. Router priorities can be between 0 and 255, if set to 0 the router will not become the designated or backup router. If two routers have the same priority, the router with the highest router Identifier (ID) will then take precedence.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker who is able to configure OSPF with the relevant authentication configuration, could configure a higher priority in order to take precedence over the existing router. If an attacker is able to control a routing device they would be able to: monitor network traffic sent between network segments</li>

          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>To perform this attack, the attacker would first have to determine the existing OSPF configuration. If authentication credentials are used, the attacker could extract them from the captured network packets. With MD5-based authentication, the attacker would have use a dictionary/brute-force attack in order to determine the authentication key. Additionally, the attacker would require access to a network segment where they could participate in OSPF routing. The attacker could then configure their router with a higher priority in order to perform the attack. All of the software required to complete each of these components can be downloaded from the Internet.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>

          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>BGP is a routing protocol that allows network devices to dynamically adapt to changes to the network topology. BGP routers update their neighbors with changes such as network link status changes. BGP route flapping is a condition where routing tables are constantly being updated due to a link transitioning between up and down status. These transitions cause routing tables to be continuously updated across the infrastructure. Routing devices can be configured with BGP route dampening in order to help mitigate against constant route flapping.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Excessive route updates, caused by a link status constantly changing between up to down, can impact network routing performance. Network routing could slow with network packets being dropped, possibly causing a DoS condition.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>It is possible for an attacker to send BGP packets to a router to update the routing table and cause a route flapping condition. However, the attacker may need additional information in order to perform the attack, such as a BGP password.</p>

          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>A router that acts as a proxy for ARP requests will extend layer two access across multiple network segments, potentially breaking perimeter security.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>A network device with proxy ARP enabled will proxy ARP requests for all hosts on those interfaces. A number of ARP tools can be downloaded from the Internet for use in exploiting this issue.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that, if not required, the Proxy ARP feature should be disabled on all interfaces.</li>

          <h3>1. ICMP Unreachable Messages Were Enabled</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>When a network packet is sent to a destination host or service that is unreachable, a ICMP unreachable message can be sent from a network gateway or the destination host to inform the requester that it was unreachable. If it is a host that is unreachable the message will be in the form of an ICMP host unreachable message. ICMP unreachable messages are described in more detail in RFC 792.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker who was performing network scans to determine what services were available would be able to scan a device more quickly. If the device being scanned sends ICMP unreachable messages, informing the attacker that a network or protocol is not supported, the attacker will not have to wait for a connection time-out.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>The ICMP messages are automatically returned by a device with the ICMP unreachable feature enabled. Network scanning tools can be downloaded from the Internet that are able to perform a wide variety of scan types and take into account ICMP unreachable messages.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that, if not required, ICMP unreachable messages should be disabled. However, it is important to note that whilst disabling of ICMP unreachable messages will not stop a network scan, it will make the scan more time consuming for the attacker to perform.</li>

          <h3>1. ICMP Redirect Messages Were Enabled</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>When sending network traffic through a router, ICMP redirect messages could be sent to the router in order to indicate a specific route that the sending host would like the network traffic to take. On a router that accepts ICMP redirect message the network traffic will be forwarded using the specified route.Furthermore, some routers will cache the new routing information for use with future network packets.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker could use ICMP redirects to modify the route that a packet takes through a network. However, it is worth noting that on networks with functional network routing, disabling ICMP redirects will have little to no effect.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>ICMP redirect messages will be accepted, but not necessarily acted upon. An attacker could download software from the Internet in order to perform this attack.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>

          <h3>1. Connection Timeout not configured</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Connection timeouts can be configured for a number of the device services. If a timeout were configured on an administrative service, an administrator that did not correctly terminate the connection would have it automatically closed after the timeout expires. However, if a timeout is not configured, or is configured to be a long timeout, an unauthorised user may be able to gain access using the administrator's previously logged-in connection.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker who was able to gain access to a connection that had not expired, would be able to continue using that connection. A connection could be a console port on the device that was not correctly terminated or a remote administrative connection.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>The attacker would have to gain physical access to the device to use the console port, or gain remote access to an administration machine that is attached to the port. To gain access to remote connections, an attacker would have to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the device. The attacker would then have to take over the connection, which could be very difficult with some services. Tools are available on the Internet that would facilitate the monitoring of network connections.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv ecommends that a timeout period of ten minutes be configured for connections to the device</li>
