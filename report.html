    <h2>2.1.1 Security Issue Overview</h2>
    <p>Each security issue identified by DigInv is described with a finding, the impact of the issue, how easy it would be for an attacker to exploit the issue and a recommendation.</p>
    <h4>Issue Finding</h4>
    <p>The issue finding describes what DigInv identified during the security audit. Typically, the finding will include background information on what particular configuration settings are prior to describing what was found.</p>
    <h4>Issue Impact</h4>
    <p>The issue impact describes what an attacker could achieve from exploiting the security audit finding. However, it is worth noting that the impact of an issue can often be influenced by other configuration settings,         which could heighten or partially mitigate the issue. For example, a weak password could be partially         mitigated if the access gained from using it is restricted in some way.</p>
    <h4>Issue Ease</h4>
    <p>The issue ease describes the knowledge, skill, level of access and time scales that would be required by an attacker in order to exploit an issue. The issue ease will describe, where relevant, if any Open Source or commercially available tools could be used to exploit an issue.</p>
    <h4>Issue Recommandation</h4>
    <p>Each issue includes a recommendation section which describes the steps that DigInv recommends should be taken in order to mitigate the issue. The recommendation includes, where relevant, the commands that can be used to resolve the issue.</p>
    <h2>2.1.2 Rating System Overview</h2>
    <p>Each issue identified in the security audit is rated against both the impact of the issue and how easy it would be for an attacker to exploit. The fix rating provides a guide to the effort required to resolve the issue. The overall rating for the issue is calculated based on the issue's impact and ease ratings.</p>
    <h4>Impact Rating</h4>
    <p>An issue's impact rating is determined using the criteria outlined in the Table below.</p><table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>0</th>
      <td>CRITICAL</td>
      <td>These issues can pose a very significant security threat. The issues that have a critical impact are typically those that would allow an attacker to gain full administrative access to the device. For a firewall device, allowing all traffic to pass through the device unfiltered would receive this rating as filtering traffic to protect other devices is the primary purpose of a firewall.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>HIGH</td>
      <td>These issues pose a significant threat to security, but have some limitations on the extent to which they can be abused. User level access to a device and a DoS vulnerability in a critical service would fall into this category. A firewall device that allowed significant unfiltered access, such as allowing entire subnets through or not filtering in all directions, would fall into this category. A router that allows significant modification of its routing configuration would also fall into this category.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>MEDIUM</td>
      <td>These issues have significant limitations on the direct impact they can cause. Typically, these issues would include significant information leakage issues, less significant DoS issues or those that provide significantly limited access. An SNMP service that is secured with a default or a dictionary-based community string would typically fall into this rating, as would a firewall that allows unfiltered access to a range of services on a device.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>LOW</td>
      <td>These issues represent a low level security threat. A typical issue would involve information leakage that could be useful to an attacker, such as a list of users or version details</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>
      <td>INFORMATIONAL</td>
      <td>These issues represent a very low level of security threat. These issues include minor information leakage, unnecessary services or legacy protocols that present no real threat to security</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>EASY</td>
      <td>The issue requires some knowledge for an attacker to exploit, which could be performed using standard operating system tools or tools downloaded from the Internet. An administrative service without or with a default password would fall into this category, as would a simple software vulnerability exploit.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>2</th>
      <td>MODERATE</td>
      <td>The issue requires specific knowledge on behalf of an attacker. The issue could be exploited using a combination of operating system tools or publicly available tools downloaded from the Internet.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>3</th>
      <td>CHALLENGE</td>
      <td>A security issue that falls into this category would require significant effort and knowledge on behalf of the attacker. The attacker may require specific physical access to resources or to the network infrastructure in order to successfully exploit the vulnerability. Furthermore, a combination of attacks may be required.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>4</th>

          <h3>1. UDP Small Services Enabled</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Some devices and platforms provide a collection of simple User Datagram Protocol (UDP) network services, which are also sometimes referred to Fix: Quick as small services. These services provide little functionality and are rarely used and they typically include:
Echo (defined in RFC 862) returns any data sent to it back to the connecting client;
Discard (defined in RFC 863) ignores any data sent to it by a connecting client;
Chargen (defined in RFC 864) generates printable characters which are returned to the connecting client.
DigInv determined that the UDP small servers were enabled</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker could use the UDP small servers as part of a DoS attack. UDP is a connection-less protocol and an experienced attacker could forge network packets to use the echo and chargen services to increase the network traffic and system utilization of devices offering the services. Additionally, each running service increases the chances of an attacker being able to identify the device and successfully compromise it. Although not as significant, some of the services may provide an attacker with simple information that could then be used as part of a targeted attack against the system.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Tools that can be used to connect to these services are installed by default on some systems or can be downloaded from the Internet.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that the UDP small servers should be disabled.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. No Inbound TCP Connection Keep-Alives</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>The keep-alive messages are used to determine if a connection is active or has become orphaned and is no longer used. Depending on the result, the device can reclaim resources allocated to inbound connections that have become orphaned. Connections to a device could become orphaned if a connection becomes disrupted or if the client has not properly terminated a connection.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker could attempt a DoS attack against a device by exhausting the number of possible connections. To perform this attack, the attacker could keep requesting new connections to the device and spoof the source IP addresses. This would then prevent any new legitimate connections to the device from being made as the device awaits the completion of the connection attempts that have already been initiated. This attack would prevent both users and administrators from connecting to the device.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Tools can be downloaded from the Internet that are capable of opening a large number of TCP connections without correctly terminating them.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that TCP keep alive messages should be sent to detect and drop orphaned connections from remote systems.</li>

          <h3>3. Service Password Encryption Disabled</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Cisco service passwords are stored by default in their clear-text form rather than being encrypted. However, it is possible to have these passwords stored using the reversible Cisco type-7 encryption.
DigInv determined that the Cisco device Router was not running the password encryption service that helps provide a basic level of encryption to passwords that otherwise would be stored in clear-text.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>If a malicious user were to see a Cisco configuration that contained clear-text passwords, they could use the passwords to access the device. However, an attacker who had access to a Cisco configuration file would easily be able to reverse the passwords.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Even though it is trivial to reverse Cisco type-7 passwords, they do provide a greater level of security than clear-text passwords. Tools are widely available on the Internet that reverse Cisco type-7 passwords.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that the Cisco password encryption service be enabled. The Cisco password encryption service can be started with the following Cisco IOS command:</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="command">service password-encryption</p>

          <h3>4. CDP enabled</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>CDP is a proprietary protocol that was developed and is primarily used by Cisco. A CDP enabled device can be configured to broadcast.
CDP packets on the network enabling network management applications and CDP aware devices to identify each other. CDP packets include information about thesender, such as OS version and IP address information.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>CDP packets contain information about the sender, such as hardware model information, operating system version and IP address details. This information would give an attacker valuable information about the device. The attacker could then use this information as part of a targeted attack.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>CDP packets are broadcast to an entire network segment. The attacker or malicious user would require access to a network segment on which the CDP packets are broadcast and network monitoring software. A wide variety of network monitoring, packet capture and analysis tools can be downloaded from the Internet.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that, if not required, CDP should be disabled.
In some configurations with IP phones, deployed using either Auto Discovery or Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), the CDP service may need to be enabled. However, if the device supports disabling CDP on individual interfaces, then DigInv recommends that it should be disabled on all the interfaces where it is not required.</li>

          <h3>5. VTP Was In Server Mode</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>VTP was developed by Cisco to assist with the management of VLANs over multiple devices. The protocol enables the addition, renaming and deletion of VLANs on a single switch to be propagated to other network switches in the same VTP domain. A device in VTP server mode will transmit VTP packets containing VLAN information. If a device in VTP client mode in the same domain receives a VTP network packet with a higher revision number the changes will be applied.
 DigInv determined that VTP was in server mode.It is worth mentioning that although the VTP was found to be in server mode(adefault setting), no VTP domain was configured. However, there have been instances where a device in this configuration have had their VTP domain setremotely from other networked devices.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker could determine the VLAN configuration by capturing VTP packets sent from the device and VTP packets are not encrypted, even when a password is specified. The attacker could then use the VLAN information or password as part of a targeted attack.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Tools that are capable of capturing network packets are available on the Internet and installed by default on some OS.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that, if not required, VTP should be disabled or placed in transparent mode, even if no VTP domain has been configured.</li>

          <h3>6. The BOOTP Service Was Not Disabled</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>BOOTstrap Protocol (BOOTP) is a datagram protocol that allows compatible hosts to load their operating system over the network from a BOOTP server. Cisco routers are capable of acting as BOOTP servers for other Cisco devices and the service is enabled by default. However, BOOTP is rarely used and may represent a security risk.
DigInv determined that BOOTP was not disabled. However, it is worth noting that not all Cisco devices support BOOTP.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker could use the BOOTP service to download a copy of the router's IOS software.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>Tools are available on the Internet to access BOOTP servers.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that, if not required, the BOOTP service be disabled. The following command can be used to disable BOOTP:</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>7. Domain Lookups were enabled</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Cisco IOS-based devices support name lookups using the Domain Name System (DNS). However, if a DNS server has not been configured, then the DNS request is broadcast.
DigInv determined that name lookups had not been disabled and no DNS servers had been configured.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker who was able to capture network traffic could monitor DNS queries from the Cisco Router. Furthermore, Cisco devices can connect to Telnet servers by supplying only the hostname or IP address of the server. A mistyped Cisco command could be interpreted as an attempt to connect to a Telnet server and broadcast on the network.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>It would be trivial for an attacker to capture network traffic broadcast from a Cisco Router. Furthermore, network traffic capture tools are widely available on the Internet.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that domain lookups be disabled. Domain lookups can be disabled with the following command:</li>

          <h3>8. No Network Filtering Rules Were Configured</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Network filtering can be configured to restrict access to network services from only those hosts that require the access, helping to prevent unauthorized access. When configured, network filter rules are processed sequentially and the first rule in the filter rule list which matches the network packet is applied.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Typically firewall appliances will drop network traffic if there are no network filtering rules configured. Whereas most non-firewall appliances will usually allow all network traffic if no network filtering rules have been configured. Although no network filter rules had been configured the default action was to drop the all network packets. Therefore an attacker, or malicious user, would not be able to access network services as all network traffic would be blocked.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>No specialist skills or tools are required by the attacker to exploit this issue.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>DigInv recommends that network filter rules should be configured to help prevent unauthorized access to network services.DigInv recommends that: filter rules should only allow access to specific destination addresses</li>

            <li> filter rules should only allow access from specific source addresses</li>

            <li> ICMP filter rules should specify a specific message type</li>
            <li> filter rules should always drop network packets and not reject them</li>

          <h3>9. PAD Service Enabled</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>The PAD service enables X.25 commands and connections between PAD devices and access servers, converting the character stream data into network packets and network packets into character stream data. The PAD service is enabled by default on some devices but it is only required if support for X.25 links are necessary.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>In addition to the extra overhead, running unused services increases the chances of an attacker finding a security hole or fingerprinting a device.</li>

          <h3>10. Connection Timeout not configured</h3>
          <h5>observation</h5>
          <p>Connection timeouts can be configured for a number of the device services. If a timeout were configured on an administrative service, an administrator that did not correctly terminate the connection would have it automatically closed after the timeout expires. However, if a timeout is not configured, or is configured to be a long timeout, an unauthorised user may be able to gain access using the administrator's previously logged-in connection.</p>
          <h5>impact</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>An attacker who was able to gain access to a connection that had not expired, would be able to continue using that connection. A connection could be a console port on the device that was not correctly terminated or a remote administrative connection.</li>
          </ul>
          <h5>ease</h5>
          <p>The attacker would have to gain physical access to the device to use the console port, or gain remote access to an administration machine that is attached to the port. To gain access to remote connections, an attacker would have to be able to intercept network traffic between the client and the device. The attacker would then have to take over the connection, which could be very difficult with some services. Tools are available on the Internet that would facilitate the monitoring of network connections.</p>
          <h5>recommandation</h5>
          <ul>

          <h3>1. CVE-2017-12238</h3>
          <h5>Description</h5>
          <p>A vulnerability in the Virtual Private LAN Service (VPLS) code of Cisco IOS 15.0 through 15.4 for Cisco Catalyst 6800 Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a C6800-16P10G or C6800-16P10G-XL type line card to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. The vulnerability is due to a memory management issue in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a large number of VPLS-generated MAC entries in the MAC address table of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a C6800-16P10G or C6800-16P10G-XL type line card to crash, resulting in a DoS condition. This vulnerability affects Cisco Catalyst 6800 Series Switches that are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS Software and have a Cisco C6800-16P10G or C6800-16P10G-XL line card in use with Supervisor Engine 6T. To be vulnerable, the device must also be configured with VPLS and the C6800-16P10G or C6800-16P10G-XL line card needs to be the core-facing MPLS interfaces. Cisco Bug IDs: CSCva61927.</p>
